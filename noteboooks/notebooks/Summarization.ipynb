Under the assumption that all subgradients are uniformly bounded, the distributed subgradient descent algorithm with diminishing step-sizes is proved to asymptotically converge to one of the optimal solutions. When these subgradients are exactly available, the proposed algorithm can be taken as a distributed extension of the subgradient rule proposed in [, ].

Under some diminishing step size, we have shown the exact solvability of the distributed optimization problem if the accumulated approximation error introduced by inexact subgradients is not too large. To our best knowledge, this might be the first attempt to solve the formulated distributed constrained optimization problem using only inexact subgradients of local objective functions. This led us to investigate the solvability of the formulated distributed constrained optimization problem () working with inexact subgradients of the local objective functions. Nevertheless, most of these results still require the exact gradient or subgradient information of the local objective functions at each given estimate.\n",
