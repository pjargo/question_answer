Introduction\nA contact manifold is an odd-dimensional manifold Y 2n+1 together with a\nmaximally non-integrable hyperplane distribution \u03be. In a contact manifold,\nLegendrian submanifolds play a central role. These are the maximal integral\nsubmanifolds of \u03be: \u039bn such that Tp\u039b \u2282 \u03be, for all p \u2208 \u039b. In general, Legendrian\nsubmanifolds are plentiful and easy to construct. In this article we will restrict\nour attention to the contact manifold R3 with its standard contact structure\n\u03be = ker \u03b1, where \u03b1 = dz \u2212 ydx. In this setting, every smooth knot or link\nhas an in\ufb01nite number of non-equivalent Legendrian representatives. More\nbackground on Legendrian knots is given in Section 2.\nThe even-dimensional siblings of contact manifolds are symplectic mani-\nfolds.\nThese are even-dimensional manifolds M 2n equipped with a closed,\nnon-degenerate 2-form \u03c9. In symplectic manifolds, Lagrangian submanifolds\nplay a central role. Lagrangian submanifolds are the maximal dimensional\nsubmanifolds where \u03c9 vanishes on the tangent spaces: Ln such that \u03c9|L = 0.\nWhen the symplectic manifold is exact, \u03c9 = d\u03bb, it is important to understand\nthe more restrictive subset of exact Lagrangians: these are submanifolds where\n\u03bb|L is an exact 1-form. Geometrically, L exact means that for any closed curve\n\u03b3 \u2282 L,\n\ufffd\n\u03b3 \u03bb = 0. In this article, we will restrict our attention to a symplectic\nmanifold that is symplectomorphic to R4 with its standard symplectic struc-\nture \u03c90 = \ufffd dxi\u2227dyi. In contrast to Legendrians, Lagrangians are scarce. For\n1\narXiv:2101.00031v1  [math.SG]  31 Dec 2020\n2\nCONSTRUCTIONS OF LAGRANGIAN COBORDISMS\nexample, in R4 with its standard symplectic structure, the torus is the only\nclosed surface that will admit a Lagrangian embedding into R4. A famous\ntheorem of Gromov [Gro85] states that there are no closed, exact Lagrangian\nsubmanifolds of R4.\nThere has been a great deal of recent interest in a certain class of non-closed,\nexact Lagrangian submanifolds, known as Lagrangian cobordisms. These La-\ngrangian submanifolds live in the symplectization of a contact manifold and\nhave cylindrical ends over Legendrians. In this article, we will focus on exact,\norientable Lagrangian cobordisms from the Legendrian \u039b\u2212 to the Legendrian\n\u039b+ that live in the symplectization of R3; this symplectization is R \u00d7 R3\nequipped with the exact symplectic form \u03c9 = d(et\u03b1), where t is the coor-\ndinate on R and \u03b1 = dz \u2212 ydx is the standard contact form on R3.\nSee\nFigure 5 for a schematic picture of a Lagrangian cobordism and De\ufb01nition 1\nfor a formal de\ufb01nition.\nSuch Lagrangian cobordisms were \ufb01rst introduced\nin Symplectic Field Theory (SFT) [EGH00]: in relative SFT, we get a cat-\negory whose objects are Legendrians and whose morphisms are Lagrangian\ncobordisms. Lagrangian \ufb01llings occur when \u039b\u2212 = \u2205 and are key objects in the\nFukaya category, which is an important invariant of symplectic four-manifolds.\nA Lagrangian cap occurs when \u039b+ = \u2205.\nA basic question tied to understanding the general existence and behav-\nior of Lagrangian submanifolds is to understand the existence of Lagrangian\ncobordisms: Given two Legendrians \u039b\u00b1, when does there exist a Lagrangian\ncobordism from \u039b\u2212 to \u039b+? There are known to be a number of obstructions\nto this relation on Legendrian submanifolds coming from both classical and\nnon-classical invariants of the Legendrians \u039b\u00b1. Some of these obstructions\nare described in Section 2.3. To complement the obstructions, there are some\nknown constructions. For example, it is well known [EG98, Cha10, EHK16]\nthat there exists a Lagrangian cobordism between Legendrians \u039b\u00b1 that dif-\nfer by Legendrian isotopy. In addition, by [EHK16, Cha12], it is known that\nthere exists a Lagrangian cobordism from \u039b\u2212 to \u039b+ if \u039b\u2212 can be obtained\nfrom \u039b+ by a \u201cpinch\u201d move or if \u039b+ = \u039b\u2212 \u222aU, where U denotes a Legendrian\nunknot with maximal Thurston-Bennequin number of \u22121 that is contained in\nthe complement of a ball containing \u039b\u2212. Topologically, between these slices,\nthe cobordism changes by a saddle move (1-handle) and the addition of a lo-\ncal minimum (0-handle); see Figure 1. It is important to notice that there is\nnot an elementary move corresponding to a local maximum (2-handle) move.\nBy stacking these individual cobordisms obtained from isotopy, saddles, and\nminimums, one obtains what is commonly referred to as a decomposable La-\ngrangian cobordism. Through these moves, it is easy to construct Lagrangian\ncobordisms and \ufb01llings; see an example in Figure 7.\nTowards understanding the existence of Lagrangians, it is natural to ask:\nDoes there exist a Lagrangian cobordism from \u039b\u2212 to \u039b+ if and only if there\nexists a decomposable Lagrangian cobordism from \u039b\u2212 to \u039b+? We know the an-\nswer to this question is \u201cNo\u201d: by studying the \u201cmovies\u201d of the not necessarily\nCONSTRUCTIONS OF LAGRANGIAN COBORDISMS\n3\n(A)\n(B)\n\u039b+\n\u039b\u2212\n\u039b+\nFigure 1. (A) The pinch move on \u039b+ produces a Lagrangian\nsaddle. (B) \u039b+ obtained by introducing an unknotted compo-\nnent to \u039b\u2212 corresponds to the Lagrangian cobordism having a\nlocal min.\nLegendrian slices of a Lagrangian. Sauvaget, Murphy, and Lin [Sau04, Lin16]\nhave shown that there exists a genus two Lagrangian cap of the Legendrian\nunknot with Thurston-Bennequin number equal to \u22123 and rotation number 0.\nThe Lagrangian diagram moves used by [Lin16] to construct a Lagrangian cap\nare described in Section 3.3. The necessity of a local maximum when \u039b+ \u0338= \u2205\nis not currently understood.\nTo formulate some precise motivating questions, we will use ribbon cobor-\ndism to denote a 2n-dimensional manifold that can be built from k-handles\nwith k \u2264 n. This idea of restricting the handle index is well known in symplec-\ntic topology: Eliashberg [CE12, Oan15] has shown that any 2n-dimensional\nStein manifold admits a handle decomposition with handles of dimension at\nmost n, and thus any 2n-dimensional Stein cobordism between closed, (2n\u22121)-\ndimensional contact manifolds must be ribbon. Working in the relative set-\nting with submanifolds and using the handle decomposition from the \u201cheight\u201d\nfunction given by the R coordinate on R \u00d7 R3, we see that all decompos-\nable 2-dimensional Lagrangian cobordisms between 1-dimensional Legendrian\nsubmanifolds are ribbon cobordisms. We are led to the following natural ques-\ntions.\nMotivating Questions. Suppose \u039b+ \u0338= \u2205 and there exists a connected La-\ngrangian cobordism L from \u039b\u2212 to \u039b+. Then:\n(1) Does there exist a decomposable Lagrangian cobordism from \u039b\u2212 to \u039b+?\n(2) Does there exist a ribbon Lagrangian cobordism from \u039b\u2212 to \u039b+?\n(3) Is L Lagrangian isotopic to a ribbon and/or decomposable Lagrangian\ncobordism?\nThere are some results known about Motivating Question (3) for the spe-\ncial case of the simplest Legendrian unknot.\nIf U denotes the Legendrian\nunknot with Thurston-Bennequin number \u22121, it is known that every (ex-\nact) Lagrangian \ufb01lling is orientable [Rit09], and there is a unique (exact,\norientable) Lagrangian \ufb01lling of U up to compactly supported Hamiltonian\n4\nCONSTRUCTIONS OF LAGRANGIAN COBORDISMS\nisotopy [EP96].\nMoreover, any Lagrangian cobordism from U to U is La-\ngrangian isotopic, via a compactly supported Hamiltonian isotopy, to one in\na countable collection given by the trace of a Legendrian isotopy induced by\na rotation [CDRGG].\nMotivating Questions (1) and (2) are closely related and have deep ties to\nimportant questions in topology. Observe that a \u201cyes\u201d answer to (1) implies a\n\u201cyes\u201d to (2): if the existence of a Lagrangian cobordism implies the existence\nof a decomposable Lagrangian cobordism, then we also know the existence of\na ribbon cobordism. Also note that when \u039b+ is topologically a slice knot and\n\u039b\u2212 = \u2205, (2) is a symplectic version of the topological Slice-Ribbon conjecture:\nis every Lagrangian slice disk a ribbon disk? Cornwell, Ng, and Sivek conjec-\nture that the answer to Motivating Question (1) and (3) is \u201cNo\u201d: using the\ntheory of satellites, we know that there is a Lagrangian concordance between\n\u039b\u00b1 shown in Figure 2, and in [CNS16, Conjecture 3.3] it is conjectured that\nthe concordance between the pair is not decomposable.\n\u039b+\n\u039b\u2212\nFigure 2. There is a Lagrangian concordance between these\nLegendrian knots that is conjectured to be non-decomposable.\nHere \u039b\u2212 is a Legendrian trefoil and \u039b+ is a Legendrian White-\nhead double of m(946).\nVery recently, Roberta Guadagni has discovered additional combinatorial\nmoves that can be used to construct a \u201cmovie,\u201d meaning a sequence of slice\npictures, of a Lagrangian cobordism; Figure 9 illustrates one of these tangle\nmoves. With one of Guadagni\u2019s moves, it is possible to construct a movie of\na Lagrangian cobordism between the Legendrians pictured in Figure 2; see\nFigure 10. Guadagni\u2019s moves are \u201cgeometric\u201d: they are developed through\nproofs similar to those used in the satellite procedure, and thus the handle\nattachments involved in the cobordism are not obvious. In particular, at this\nCONSTRUCTIONS OF LAGRANGIAN COBORDISMS\n5\npoint it is not known if Guadagni\u2019s tangle moves are independent from the\ndecomposable moves.\nThis survey article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide some\nbackground on Legendrians and Lagrangians, formally de\ufb01ne Lagrangian cobor-\ndisms, and summarize known obstructions to the existence of Lagrangian\ncobordisms. In Section 3, we describe three \u201ccombinatorial\u201d ways to construct\nLagrangian cobordisms, and in Section 4, we describe more abstract \u201cgeo-\nmetric\u201d ways to construct Lagrangian concordances and cobordisms through\nsatellites. Then in Section 5, we describe some potential pathways \u2013 through\nthe theory of rulings, Heegaard-Floer homology, and contact surgery \u2013 to po-\ntentially show the existence of Legendrians that are Lagrangian cobordant but\nare not related by a decomposable Lagrangian cobordism.\nAcknowledgements: This project was initiated at the workshop Women in\nSymplectic and Contact Geometry and Topology (WiSCoN) that took place\nat ICERM in July 2019.

Legendrian Knots and Links. In this section, we give a very brief\nintroduction to Legendrian submanifolds in R3 and their invariants. More\ndetails can be found, for example, in the survey paper [Etn05].\nIn R3, the standard contact structure \u03be is a 2-dimensional plane \ufb01eld\ngiven by the kernel of the 1-form \u03b1 = dz \u2212 ydx. In (R3, \u03be = ker \u03b1), a Leg-\nendrian knot is a knot in R3 that is tangent to \u03be everywhere. A useful way\nto visualize a Legendrian knot is to project it from R3 to R2. There are two\nuseful projections: the Lagrangian projection\n\u03c0L :\nR3\n\u2192\nR2\n(x, y, z)\n\ufffd\u2192\n(x, y),\nas well as the front projection\n\u03c0F :\nR3\n\u2192\nR2\n(x, y, z)\n\ufffd\u2192\n(x, z).\nAn example of a Legendrian trefoil is shown in Figure 3.\nLegendrian submanifolds are equivalent if they can be connected by a 1-\nparameter family of Legendrian submanifolds. In fact, for each topological\nknot type there are in\ufb01nitely many di\ufb00erent Legendrian knots. Indeed, we\ncan stabilize a Legendrian knot (as shown in Figure 4) to get another Legen-\ndrian knot of the same topological knot type. We can see that these are not\nLegendrian equivalent using Legendrian invariants.\n6\nCONSTRUCTIONS OF LAGRANGIAN COBORDISMS\nx\nz\nx\ny\nFigure 3. The front projection (left) and the Lagrangian pro-\njection (right) of a Legendrian trefoil.\nFigure 4. Two ways to stabilize a Legendrian knot in front projection.\nTwo useful classical invariants of Legendrian knots \u039b are the Thurston-\nBennequin number tb(\u039b) and the rotation number r(\u039b). They can be com-\nputed easily from front projections. Given the front projection of a Legendrian\nknot or link \u039b, the Thurston-Bennequin number is\ntb(\u039b) = writhe(\u03c0F(\u039b)) \u2212 #(right cusps),\nwhere the writhe is the number of crossings counted with sign.\nOnce the\nLegendrian knot is equipped with an orientation, the rotation number is\nr(\u039b) = 1\n2\n\ufffd\n#(down cusps) \u2212 #(up cusps)\n\ufffd\n.\nOne can use these two invariants to see that stabilizations change the Legen-\ndrian knot type.\nIn future sections, we will not assume that our Legendrians \u039b\u00b1 come equipped\nwith an orientation. In our Motivating Questions described in Section 1, our\nLagrangian cobordisms are always orientable, so the existence of a Lagrangian\ncobordism from \u039b\u2212 to \u039b+ will induce orientations on \u039b\u00b1.\nThere are many powerful non-classical invariants that can be assigned to\na Legendrian knot. Although this will not be a focus of this paper, we will\ngive a brief description of some of these invariants. One important invariant\nstems from normal rulings, de\ufb01ned independently by Chekanov and Pushkar\n[PC05] and Fuchs [Fuc03]. A count of normal rulings leads to ruling poly-\nnomials [PC05]; more details will be discussed in Section 5.1. Through the\nclosely related theory of\ngenerating families, one can also associate invari-\nant polynomials that record the dimensions of generating family homology\ngroups [Tra01, JT06, FR11, ST13]. In addition, through the theory of pseudo-\nholomoprhic curves, one can associate to a Legendrian \u039b a di\ufb00erential graded\nalgebra (DGA), A(\u039b) [Che02, Eli98]. An augmentation is a DGA map from\nA(\u039b) to a \ufb01eld. The count of augmentations is closely related to the count\nCONSTRUCTIONS OF LAGRANGIAN COBORDISMS\n7\nof ruling polynomials [Fuc03, NR13, NS06]. Augmentations can be used to\nconstruct \ufb01nite-dimensional linearized contact homology groups [Che02], which\nare often known to be isomorphic to the generating family homology groups\n[FR11]. In addition, there are invariants for Legendrian knots coming from\nHeegaard Floer Homology [LOSS09] [OST08].\n2.2. Lagrangian Cobordisms. Lagrangian cobordisms between Legendrian\nsubmanifolds always have \u201ccylindrical ends\u201d over the Legendrians, but other\nconditions vary: sometimes it is speci\ufb01ed that the Lagrangian is exact, is\nembedded (or immersed), is orientable, or has a \ufb01xed Maslov class. In this\npaper, a Lagrangian cobordism is always exact, embedded, and orientable.\nDe\ufb01nition 1. Let \u039b\u00b1 be two Legendrian knots or links in (R3, \u03be = ker \u03b1).\nA Lagrangian cobordism L from \u039b\u2212 to \u039b+ is an embedded, orientable\nLagrangian surface in the symplectization (R \u00d7 R3, d(et\u03b1)) such that for some\nN > 0,\n(1) L \u2229 ([\u2212N, N] \u00d7 R3) is compact,\n(2) L \u2229 ((N, \u221e) \u00d7 R3) = (N, \u221e) \u00d7 \u039b+,\n(3) L \u2229 ((\u2212\u221e, \u2212N) \u00d7 R3) = (\u2212\u221e, \u2212N) \u00d7 \u039b\u2212, and\n(4) there exists a function f : L \u2192 R and constant numbers c\u00b1 such that\net\u03b1|TL = df, where f|(\u2212\u221e,\u2212N)\u00d7\u039b\u2212 = c\u2212, and f|(N,\u221e)\u00d7\u039b+ = c+.\nA Lagrangian \ufb01lling of \u039b+ is a Lagrangian cobordism with \u039b\u2212 = \u2205; a La-\ngrangian cap of \u039b\u2212 is a Lagrangian cobordism with \u039b+ = \u2205. A Lagrangian\nconcordance occurs when \u039b\u00b1 are knots and L has genus 0.\nFigure 5 is a schematic representation of a Lagrangian cobordism.\nt\nN\n\u039b+\n\u039b\u2212\nL\n\u2212N\nFigure 5. A Lagrangian cobordism from \u039b\u2212 to \u039b+.\nRemark 1. In condition (4) of De\ufb01nition 1, the fact that \u039b\u00b1 are Legendrian\nwill guarantee that f\u00b1 will be locally constant. Using this, it follows that\nany genus zero Lagrangian surface that is cylindrical over Legendrian knots\nwill be exact. When \u039b\u00b1 have multiple components, one needs to check that\nthe constant does not vary: this condition guarantees the exactness of the\n8\nCONSTRUCTIONS OF LAGRANGIAN COBORDISMS\nLagrangian cobordism obtained by \u201cgluing\u201d together Lagrangian cobordisms\n[Cha15a].\nRemark 2. In contrast to topological cobordisms, Lagrangian cobordisms form\na non-symmetric relationship on Legendrian knots [Cha15b]. In this article\nwe will always denote the direction of increasing Rt coordinate by an arrow.\n2.3. Obstructions to Lagrangian Cobordisms. The focus of this paper\nis on constructing Lagrangian cobordisms between two given Legendrians \u039b\u00b1.\nIn the smooth world, any two knots are related by a smooth cobordism, but in\nthis more restrictive Lagrangian world, there are a number of obstructions that\nare important to keep in mind when trying to explicitly construct Lagrangian\ncobordisms. Here we mention a few that come from classical and non-classical\ninvariants of the Legendrians \u039b\u00b1.\nObstructions:\n(1) If there exists a Lagrangian cobordism of genus g between \u039b\u2212 and\n\u039b+, then there must exist a smooth cobordism of genus g between the\nsmooth knot types of \u039b\u2212 and \u039b+. Thus any obstruction of a smooth\ngenus g cobordism between \u039b\u2212 and \u039b+ would obstruct a Lagrangian\ngenus g cobordism.\n(2) Since there are no closed, exact Lagrangian surfaces [Gro85], if there\nexists a Lagrangian cap (respectively, \ufb01lling) for \u039b, then there cannot\nexist a Lagrangian \ufb01lling (respectively, cap) of \u039b.\n(3) As shown in [Cha10], if there exists a Lagrangian cobordism L from\n\u039b\u2212 to \u039b+, then\nr(\u039b\u2212) = r(\u039b+)\nand\ntb(\u039b+) \u2212 tb(\u039b\u2212) = \u2212\u03c7(L).\nIn particular, if a Legendrian knot \u039b admits a Lagrangian \ufb01lling or\ncap, then r(\u039b) = 0.\nAlso, combining this equality on tb and the\nslice-Bennequin inequality [Rud97], we see that, when \u039b is a single\ncomponent knot, if there exists a Lagrangian cap L of \u039b, then tb(\u039b) \u2264\n\u22121 and g(L) \u2265 1.\n(4) If there exists a Maslov 0 ([EES05]) Lagrangian cobordism \u03a3 from \u039b\u2212\nto \u039b+, and \u039b\u2212 has an augmentation, then\n(a) #Aug(\u039b+; F2) \u2265 #Aug(\u039b\u2212; F2), where F2 is the \ufb01nite \ufb01eld of two\nelements, and #Aug(\u039b; F2) denotes the number of augmentations\nof \u039b to F2 up to DGA homotopy [Pan17, CSLL+20], and\n(b) the ruling polynomials R\u039b\u00b1(z) (see Section 5.1 for de\ufb01nitions)\nsatisfy\nR\u039b\u2212(q1/2 \u2212 q\u22121/2) \u2264 q\u2212\u03c7(\u03a3)/2R\u039b+(q1/2 \u2212 q\u22121/2),\nfor any q that is a power of a prime number [Pan17].\n(5) If \u039b admits a Maslov 0 Lagrangian \ufb01lling L, and if \u03f5L denotes the\naugmentation of \u039b induced by L, then LCHk\n\u03f5L(\u039b) \u223c= Hn\u2212k(L), which\nis known as the Ekholm-Seidel isomorphism [Ekh12], and whose proof\nwas completed by Dimitroglou Rizell in [DR16].\nMore generally, if\nCONSTRUCTIONS OF LAGRANGIAN COBORDISMS\n9\nthere is a cobordism from \u039b\u2212 to \u039b+, and if \u039b\u2212 admits an augmentation,\nthen [CDRGG20] provides several long exact sequences relating the\nhomology of the cobordism and the Legendrian contact (co)homologies\nof its Legendrian ends. A version of this isomorphism and these long\nexact sequences using generating families are given in [ST13].\n(6) If \u039b admits an augmentation, \u039b does not admit a Lagrangian cap, as\nthe augmentation implies the non-acyclicity of the DGA A(\u039b) [EES09,\nTheorem 5.5], and from [DR15, Corollary 1.9] if a Legendrian admits\na Lagrangian cap then its DGA A(\u039b) (with Z2 coe\ufb03cients) is acyclic.\nThere are additional obstructions, obtained through Heegaard Floer Theory,\nthat can be used to obstruct Lagrangian concordances and cobordisms [BSar,\nGJ19, BLWar]. Some of these will be discussed more in Section 5.3.\nRemark 3. Observe that the obstructions in (4) and (6) assume that the bot-\ntom \u039b\u2212 has an augmentation, and stabilized knots will never have an augmen-\ntation. It would be nice to have more obstructions when \u039b\u2212 is a stabilized\nknot. This might be possible using the theory of \u201csatellites\u201d described in Sec-\ntion 4.1: it is possible for the satellite of a stabilized Legendrian to admit an\naugmentation. See Section 4.3 for more discussions in this direction.\n3. Combinatorial Constructions of Lagrangian Cobordisms\nA convenient way of visualizing topological cobordisms is through \u201cmovies\u201d:\na sequence of pictures that represent slices of the Lagrangian. In this section,\nwe describe three known combinatorial ways to construct Lagrangian cobor-\ndisms through such an approach.\n3.1. Decomposable Moves. It is well known that if \u039b\u2212 and \u039b+ are Leg-\nendrian isotopic, then there exists a Lagrangian cobordism from \u039b\u2212 to \u039b+;\nsee, for example, [EG98, Cha10, EHK16]. Isotopy, together with two types of\nhandle moves, form the basis for decomposable Lagrangian cobordisms.\nTheorem 2 ([EHK16, BST15]). If the front diagrams of two Legendrian links\n\u039b\u2212 and \u039b+ are related by any of the following moves, there is a Lagrangian\ncobordism L from \u039b\u2212 to \u039b+.\nIsotopy: There is a Legendrian isotopy between \u039b\u2212 and \u039b+; see Fig-\nures 6(a)-6(c) for Reidemeister Move I-III.\n1-handle: The front diagram of \u039b\u2212 can be obtained from the front di-\nagram of \u039b+ by \u201cpinching\u201d two oppositely-oriented strands; see Fig-\nure 6(d). We will also refer to this move as a \u201cPinch Move.\u201d\n0-handle: The front diagram of \u039b\u2212 can be obtained from the front dia-\ngram of \u039b+ by deleting a component of \u039b+ that is the front diagram\nof a standard Legendrian unknot U with maximal Thurston-Bennequin\nnumber of \u22121 as long as there exist disjoint disks DU, DUc \u2282 R2\nxz\ncontaining the xz-projection of U and the other components of \u039b+,\nrespectively. Such an \u201cunknot \ufb01lling\u201d can be seen in Figure 6(e).\n10\nCONSTRUCTIONS OF LAGRANGIAN COBORDISMS\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\n\u2205\nFigure 6. Decomposable moves in terms of front projections.\nArrows indicate the direction of increasing Rt coordinate in the\nsymplectization. The move in (b) only shows the Reidemeister\nII move in the left cusp case, but there is an analogous move for\nthe right cusp.\nDe\ufb01nition 3. A Lagrangian cobordism L from \u039b\u2212 to \u039b+ is called elemen-\ntary if it arises from isotopy, a single 0-handle, or a single 1-handle. A La-\ngrangian cobordism L from \u039b\u2212 to \u039b+ is decomposable if it is obtained by\nstacking elementary Lagrangian cobordisms.\nObserve that there is not an elementary move corresponding to a 2-handle\n(maximum). Also note that the elementary 1-handle (saddle) move can be\nused to connect two components or to split one component into two.\nDecomposable cobordisms are particularly convenient as they are easy to\ndescribe in a combinatorial fashion, through a list of embedded Legendrian\ncurves,\n\u039b\u2212 = \u039b0 \u2192 \u039b1 \u2192 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2192 \u039bn = \u039b+,\nwhere the front projection of the Legendrian \u039bi+1 is related to that of \u039bi by\nisotopy or one of the 0-handle or 1-handle moves.\nExample 4. One can construct a Lagrangian \ufb01lling of a positive Legendrian\ntrefoil with maximal Thurston-Bennequin number using the series of moves\nshown in Figure 7: a 0-handle, followed by three Reidemeister I moves, fol-\nlowed by two 1-handles (or pinch moves). This gives a genus 1 (orientable,\nexact) Lagrangian \ufb01lling of this Legendrian trefoil. Since we are assuming\nthat Lagrangian \ufb01llings and caps are always exact, this implies that this tre-\nfoil cannot admit a Lagrangian cap; see Section 2.3 Obstructions (2).\nExample 5. Using elementary moves, one can also construct a Lagrangian\nconcordance from the unknot with tb = \u22121 to a Legendrian representative of\nthe knot m(946), as shown on Figure 8.\n3.2. Guadagni Moves. Very recently, Roberta Guadagni has discovered a\nnew \u201ctangle\u201d move; see Figure 9. This is not a local move: there are some\nCONSTRUCTIONS OF LAGRANGIAN COBORDISMS\n11\nFigure 7. A decomposable Lagrangian \ufb01lling of a Legendrian trefoil.\nFigure 8. A decomposable Lagrangian cobordism from a Leg-\nendrian unknot to a Legendrian m(946).\nglobal requirements. In particular, this move cannot be applied if all compo-\nnents of the tangle are contained in the same component of \u039b\u2212: the component\nof \u039b\u2212 containing the blue strand must be di\ufb00erent than the components con-\ntaining the other strands of the tangle.\nFigure 9. Under some global conditions, there exists a La-\ngrangian cobordism between these tangles.\nExample 6. With Guadagni\u2019s tangle move, it is possible to construct a La-\ngrangian cobordism between the Legendrians pictured in Figure 2; see Fig-\nure 10. However, at this point it is not known if Guadagni\u2019s tangle move is\nindependent of the decomposable moves.\n3.3. Lagrangian Diagram Moves. As shown in Section 3.1, decomposable\ncobordisms are constructed from 0-handles and some 1-handles (saddles) but\nno 2-handles (caps). Based on the work of Sauvaget [Sau04], Lin [Lin16] con-\nstructs a genus two cap of a twice stabilized unknot, and thus gives the \ufb01rst\nexplicit example of a non-decomposable Lagrangian cobordism. The construc-\ntion describes time-slices of a Lagrangian cobordism through a list of moves\non \u201cdecorated Lagrangian diagrams.\u201d\n12\nCONSTRUCTIONS OF LAGRANGIAN COBORDISMS\nFigure 10. A movie, using a Guadagni move, of an (orientable,\nexact) Lagrangian cobordism from the trefoil to the Whitehead\ndouble of m(946) in Figure 2.\nA decorated Lagrangian diagram is a curve in the xy-plane with the\ncompact regions decorated by a positive number, which is the area of the\nregion. Figure 11 shows some examples: in the illustration of the F move, U\nis a Lagrangian projection of the Legendrian unknot with maximal Thurston-\nBennequin number; in the illustration of the C move, Um is a decorated La-\ngrangian diagram, but is not the Lagrangian projection of a Legendrian knot.\nTheorem 7 ([Lin16]). Let \u039b\u00b1 be Legendrian links and D\u00b1 be their corre-\nsponding decorated Lagrangian projections. If one can create a sequence of\ndecorated Lagrangian diagrams\nD\u2212 = D0 \u2192 D1 \u2192 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2192 Dn = D+\nsuch that each diagram Di+1 can be obtained from Di by the following com-\nbinatorial moves, then there is a compact Lagrangian submanifold in R \u00d7 R3\nwith boundary \u039b\u2212 \u222a \u039b+, where \u039b\u00b1 \u2282 {\u00b1N} \u00d7 R3, for some N > 0.\n(1) R0: a planar isotopy that changes areas by the amount \u00b1A, for A > 0.\nThis operation can only be done in the direction speci\ufb01ed.\n(2) R2: a Reidemeister II move. One can either introduce or eliminate two\ncrossings assuming some area conditions are satis\ufb01ed: it is possible to\nintroduce or remove two crossings as long as the area of the inner\nregion, denoted by 0 in the diagram, is less than either the area \u03b4 or\nthe area \u03b7. One can also do this move with the lower strand passing\nunder the upper strand.\n(3) R3: a Reidemeister III move. One can perform a Reidemeister III\nmove as long as the area of the inner region, denoted by 0 in the dia-\ngram, is less than either the area \u03f5, the area \u03b4 or the area \u03b7. The \ufb01xed\ncenter crossing can be reversed. Additionally, the moving strand can\nalso occur as an overstrand.\nCONSTRUCTIONS OF LAGRANGIAN COBORDISMS\n13\n\u2205\n\u2205\n+A\n\u2212A +A\n\u2212A\n0\n\u03b4\n\u03b7\n0\n\u03f5\n\u03b4\n\u03b7\n0\nH+\nH\u2212\nF\nC\nR0\nR2\nR3\nU\na\na\na\na\nUm\nFigure 11.

The labels in R0\nmove represent the change of area through the move, while other\nlabels 0, \u03f5, \u03b4, \u03b7, a indicate the area of the corresponding regions;\nhere 0 represents a positive area that is smaller than either the\narea \u03f5, the area \u03b4 or the area \u03b7.\n(4) H+: a handle attachment that creates a positive crossing in the dia-\ngram.\n(5) H\u2212: a handle attachment that removes a negative crossing in the dia-\ngram.\n(6) F: a \ufb01lling that creates the diagram U, which is the Lagrangian pro-\njection of an unknot with maximal Thurston-Bennequin number.\n(7) C: a cap that eliminates the diagram Um, which is the topological mir-\nror of U.\nThese moves are called Lagrangian diagram moves. Moreover, the con-\nstructed Lagrangian will be exact if, in addition,\n(E1) Each move results in a diagram with all components having a total\nsigned area equal to 0. The signed area of a region is determined by\nthe sum of the signed heights of its Reeb chords.\n(E2) If a handle attachment merges two components of a link, the compo-\nnents being merged must be vertically split, meaning that the images of\nthe xy-projections of these components are contained in disjoint disks.\n14\nCONSTRUCTIONS OF LAGRANGIAN COBORDISMS\nRemark 4.\n(1) For condition (E2), the H\u2212 can never be applied to merge\ncomponents, and H+ can only be applied if the components being\nmerged are vertically split.\n(2) A main distinction between the Lagrangian diagram moves and the\ndecomposable moves is that each diagram Di in the middle of the\nsequence is not necessarily the Lagrangian projection of a Legendrian\nlink. They are just the xy-projection of some time ti-slice of the cobor-\ndism. Thus the Lagrangian diagram moves are more \ufb02exible than the\ndecomposable moves. However, keeping track of the areas is an added\ncomplication.\nExample 8. Figure 12 illustrates the construction of a Lagrangian torus using\nthe Lagrangian diagram moves. This torus fails to be exact since condition\n(E1) is violated. Figure 13 gives another construction of a Lagrangian torus.\nThis time, all components have signed area 0, but now condition (E2) is\nviolated.\n\u2205\n\u2205\nF\nH\u2212\nH+\nC\na\na\na\na\na\na\nFigure 12.

Geometrical Constructions of Lagrangian Cobordisms\nAn important general way to know of the existence of Lagrangian cobor-\ndisms without using the constructions described in Section 3 comes through\nthe satellite operation. In this section, we review the satellite construction and\nthen state results from [CNS16, GSY20] about the existence of a Lagrangian\nconcordance/cobordism from \u039b\u2212 to \u039b+ implying the existence of a Lagrangian\nconcordance/cobordism between corresponding satellites.\n4.1. The Legendrian Satellite Construction. We begin by reviewing the\nconstruction of a Legendrian satellite; see also [NT04, Appendix] and [CNS16,\nSection 2.2]. To construct a Legendrian satellite, begin by identifying the open\nsolid torus S1\u00d7R2 with the 1-jet space of the circle, J1S1 \u223c= T \u2217S1\u00d7R, equipped\nwith the contact form \u03b1 = dz \u2212 ydx, where x, y are the coordinates in T \u2217S1\nand z is the coordinate in R. Similar to the situation for R3 \u223c= J1R, we can\nrecover a Legendrian knot in J1S1 from its front projection in S1\nx\u00d7Rz, which is\ntypically drawn by representing S1 as an interval with its endpoints identi\ufb01ed.\nGiven an oriented Legendrian companion knot \u039b \u2282 R3 and a oriented\nLegendrian pattern knot P \u2282 J1(S1), the Legendrian neighborhood theorem\nsays that \u039b has a standard neighborhood N(\u039b) such that there is a contacto-\nmorphism \u03ba : J1(S1) \u2192 N(\u039b). The Legendrian satellite, S(\u039b, P), is then\nthe image \u03ba(P). The front projection of S(\u039b, P) is as shown in Figure 14. In\nparticular, suppose that the front projection of the pattern P intersects the\nvertical line at the boundary of the S1 interval n times. We then make an\nn-copy of \u039b by using n-disjoint copies of \u039b that all di\ufb00er by small translations\nin the z-direction. Take a point on the front projection of \u039b that is oriented\nfrom left to right, cut the front of the n-copy open along the n-copy at that\npoint, and insert the front diagram of P. The orientation on the satellite\nS(\u039b, P) is induced by the orientation on P.\n\u039b\nP\nS(\u039b, P)\nFigure 14. A example of Legendrian satellite.\nRemark 5. The satellite operation often makes Legendrian knots \u201cnicer\u201d; for\nexample, in Figure 14, the companion \u039b is stabilized and does not admit an\naugmentation or a normal ruling. However, the satellite S(\u039b, P) does admit\na normal ruling and augmentation.\n16\nCONSTRUCTIONS OF LAGRANGIAN COBORDISMS\n4.2. Lagrangian Cobordisms for Satellites. In [CNS16, Theorem 2.4],\nCornwell, Ng, and Sivek, show that Lagrangian concordance is preserved by\nthe Legendrian satellite operation.\nTheorem 9 ([CNS16]). Suppose P \u2282 J1S1 is a Legendrian knot. If there\nexists a Lagrangian concordance L from a Lengendrian knot \u039b\u2212 to a Lengen-\ndrian knot \u039b+, then there exists a Lagrangian concordance LP from S(\u039b\u2212, P)\nto S(\u039b+, P).\nIn particular, as shown in Figure 8, there is a Lagrangian concordance\nfrom \u039b\u2212, which is the Legendrian unknot with tb = \u22121, to \u039b+, which is\nthe Legendrian m(946) with maximal tb = \u22121. Using the Legendrian \u201cclasp\u201d\ntangle P as shown in Figure 14 \u2013 which produces the Legendrian Whitehead\ndouble \u2013 we can conclude that there exists a Lagrangian concordance from\nS(\u039b\u2212, P) to S(\u039b+, P). In fact, S(\u039b\u2212, P) is the positive trefoil with tb = 1.\nThus Theorem 9 implies that there exists a Lagrangian concordance between\nthe Legendrian knots in Figure 2.\nConjecture 10 ([CNS16, Conjecture 3.3]). The Lagrangian concordance from\nS(\u039b\u2212, P) to S(\u039b+, P) built through the satellite construction is not decompos-\nable.\nTheorem 9 has been extended to higher genus cobordisms by Guadagni,\nSablo\ufb00, and Yacavone in [GSY20]. To state their theorem, we need to \ufb01rst\nintroduce the notion of \u201ctwisting\u201d and then closing a tangle T \u2282 J1[0, 1].\nGiven a Legendrian tangle T \u2282 J1[0, 1], \u2206T is the tangle obtained by adding\nthe tangle T and the full twist tangle \u2206, which is illustrated in Figure 15;\nthe tangle \u2206tT can be thought of as T followed by t full twists. Given a\nLegendrian tangle T \u2282 J1[0, 1], T \u2282 J1(S1) will denote the associated closure\nto a Legendrian link.\n...\nFigure 15. For an n-stranded tangle, repeating this basic tan-\ngle n times produces a full twist.\nTheorem 11 ([GSY20]). Suppose T \u2282 J1[0, 1] is a Legendrian tangle whose\nclosure T \u2282 J1(S1) is a Legendrian knot. If there exists a Lagrangian cobor-\ndism L from \u039b\u2212 to \u039b+ of genus g(L), then there exists a Lagrangian cobordism\nLT from S(\u039b\u2212, \u22062g(L)+1T) to S(\u039b+, \u2206T).\nIn fact, Theorem 11 can be generalized to use the closure of di\ufb00erent tangles\nT\u2212 and T+ that are Lagrangian cobordant; for details, see [GSY20].\nCONSTRUCTIONS OF LAGRANGIAN COBORDISMS\n17\nRemark 6. It is natural to wonder if, along the lines of Conjecture 10, this\nhigher genus satellite procedure can create additional candidates for Legen-\ndrians that can be connected by a Lagrangian cobordism but not by a de-\ncomposable Lagrangian cobordism.\nIn [GSY20, Theorem 1.5], it is shown\nthat if the cobordism L from \u039b\u2212 to \u039b+ is decomposable and the handles in\nthe decomposition satisfy conditions known as \u201cProperty A\u201d, then the cor-\nresponding satellites S(\u039b\u2212, \u22062g(L)+1P) and S(\u039b+, \u2206P) will also be connected\nby a decomposable Lagrangian cobordism. In particular, if there exists a de-\ncomposable cobordism L that does not satisfy Property A and is not isotopic\nto a cobordism that satis\ufb01es Property A, then the satellite construction would\nlead to a higher genus candidate that generalizes Conjecture 10.\n4.3. Obstructions to Cobordisms through Satellites. In Section 2.3,\nsome known obstructions to the existence of a Lagrangian cobordism were\nmentioned. As mentioned in Remark 3, a number of these obstructions re-\nquire \u039b\u2212 to admit an augmentation, and thus in particular \u039b\u2212 must be non-\nstabilized. However, as mentioned in Remark 5, it is possible for the satellite\nof a Legendrian \u039b to admit an augmentation even if \u039b does not.\nSo the\ncontrapositive of Theorem 9 provides a potential strategy for further obstruc-\ntions to the existence of a Lagrangian cobordism when \u039b\u2212 does not admit\nan augmentation. For example, motivated by Obstruction (4) in Section 2.3,\none can ask: Can a count of augmentations give an obstruction to the ex-\nistence of a Lagrangian concordance from S(\u039b\u2212, P) to S(\u039b+, P) and thereby\nobstruct the existence of a Lagrangian concordance from \u039b\u2212 to \u039b+? In fact,\nthis augmentation count will not likely provide a further obstruction: a simple\ncomputation shows that when \u039b is stabilized enough, the number of augmen-\ntations of S(\u039b, P) only depends on the Legendrian pattern P. If trying to\npursue this path to obtain further obstructions to Lagrangian cobordisms, it\nis useful to keep in mind the following result of Ng that shows the DGA of the\nsatellite of a Legendrian \u039b might only remember the underlying knot type of\n\u039b.\nTheorem 12 ([Ng01]). Suppose \u039b1 and \u039b2 are stabilized Legendrian knots that\nare of the same topological knot type and have the same Thurston-Bennequin\nand rotation numbers. For a Legendrian pattern P whose front intersects a\nvertical line by two points, the DGAs of S(\u039b1, P) and S(\u039b2, P) are equivalent.\n5. Candidates for Non-Decomposable Lagrangian Cobordisms\nNow that we have developed some ways to construct a Lagrangian cobor-\ndism through combinatorial moves and satellites, we state some theorems that\nshow if a Lagrangian cobordism does exist, then it cannot be decomposable:\nthis addresses Motivating Question (1). While we discuss these theorems, it\nis useful to keep in mind the known obstructions to Lagrangian cobordisms\nthat were mentioned in Section 2.3.\n18\nCONSTRUCTIONS OF LAGRANGIAN COBORDISMS\n5.1. Candidates for Non-decomposable Lagrangian Cobordisms from\nNormal Rulings. One simple way to show that two Legendrians \u039b\u00b1 cannot\nbe connected by a decomposable Lagrangian cobordism comes from a count\nof \u201ccombinatorial\u201d rulings. Roughly, a normal ruling of a Legendrian \u039b is a\n\u201cdecomposition\u201d of the front projection into pairs of paths from left cusps to\nright cusps such that\n(1) each pair of paths starts from a common left cusp and ends at a com-\nmon right cusp, has no further intersections, and bounds a topological\ndisk whose boundary is smooth everywhere other than at the cusps\nand certain crossings called switches, and\n(2) near a switch, the pair of paths must be arranged as in one of the\ndiagrams in Figure 16; observe that near the switch, vertical slices of\nthe associated disks are either disjoint or the slices of one are contained\nin the slices of the other.\nFormal de\ufb01nitions of normal rulings can be found in, for example, [PC05] and\n[Fuc03].\nFigure 16. Normal rulings near a switch.\nAs an illustration, all normal rulings of a particular Legendrian trefoil are\nshown in Figure 17.\nFigure 17. All normal rulings of this max tb positive Legen-\ndrian trefoil.\nFor each normal ruling R, let s(R) and d(R) be the number of switches and\nnumber of disks, respectively. By [PC05], the ruling polynomial is\nR\u039b(z) =\n\ufffd\nR\nzs(R)\u2212d(R),\nwhere the sum is over all the normal rulings, is an invariant of \u039b under Leg-\nendrian isotopy. Normal rulings and augmentations are closely related even\nthough they are de\ufb01ned in very di\ufb00erent ways [Fuc03, FI04, NS06, Sab05].\nCONSTRUCTIONS OF LAGRANGIAN COBORDISMS\n19\nWe have the following obstruction to decomposable cobordisms in terms of\nnormal rulings.\nTheorem 13. If \u039b\u2212 has m normal rulings and \u039b+ has n normal rulings with\nm > n, then there is no decomposable Lagrangian cobordism from \u039b\u2212 to \u039b+.\nProof. One can compare the number of normal rulings of the two ends for the\ndecomposable moves, as shown in Figure 18. Thus any normal ruling of \u039b\u2212\ninduces a normal ruling of \u039b+. Di\ufb00erent normal rulings of \u039b\u2212 induce di\ufb00erent\nnormal rulings of \u039b+. Therefore the number of normal rulings of \u039b+ is bigger\nthan or equal to the number of normal rulings of \u039b\u2212.\n\u25a1\nFigure 18. Comparison of normal rulings for decomposable moves.\nHere is a strategy to show the existence of Legendrians that can be con-\nnected by a Lagrangian cobordism but not by one that is decomposable.\nStrategy 1. Choose Legendrians \u039b\u00b1 such that:\n(1) \u039b+ has fewer graded normal rulings than \u039b\u2212, and\n(2) it is possible to construct, via a combination of the combinatorial con-\nstructions from Section 3 or the satellite construction from Section 4,\na Lagrangian cobordism from \u039b\u2212 to \u039b+.\nRemark 7. If \u039b\u00b1 admit normal rulings, they will admit augmentations [FI04,\nSab05]. From Section 2.3 obstructions (4)b, we then know that if there is a\nLagrangian cobordism from \u039b\u2212 to \u039b+, their ruling polynomials satisfy\nR\u039b\u2212(q1/2 \u2212 q\u22121/2) \u2264 q\u2212\u03c7(\u03a3)/2R\u039b+(q1/2 \u2212 q\u22121/2),\nfor any q that is a power of a prime number.\nSatisfying condition (1) in\nStrategy 1 means that the polynomial on the right side of the inequality has\nfewer terms than the polynomial on the left side of the inequality. If following\nthis approach, it may be helpful to start by \ufb01rst \ufb01nding a pair of positive\ninteger coe\ufb03cient polynomials that satisfy this inequality and condition (1) at\nthe same time. One can start with checking the ruling polynomials of small\ncrossing number Legendrian knots on [CN13].\n5.2. Candidates for Non-decomposable Lagrangian Concordances from\nTopology. Observe that any decomposable Lagrangian concordance will be a\nsmooth ribbon concordance. Thus it is potentially possible to use known ob-\nstructions to ribbon concordances to \ufb01nd examples of smooth knots whose Leg-\nendrian representatives cannot be connected by a decomposable Lagrangian\n20\nCONSTRUCTIONS OF LAGRANGIAN COBORDISMS\nconcordance: constructing a Lagrangian concordance between very stabilized\nLegendrian representatives of these knot types, via the combinatorial tech-\nniques of Section 3 or geometric techniques of Section 4, will give an example\nof an exact Lagrangian concordance between knots that cannot be connected\nby a decomposable Lagrangian concordance.\nFor example, it is known [Gor81, Zem19, LZ19] that the only knot that\nadmits a ribbon concordance to the unknot is the unknot itself. This has as\na corollary the following obstruction to a decomposable Lagrangian concor-\ndance.\nTheorem 14 ([CNS16, Theorem 3.2]). If \u039b\u2212 is topologically non-trivial and\n\u039b+ is topologically an unknot, then there is no decomposable Lagrangian con-\ncordance from \u039b\u2212 to \u039b+.\nExample 15. To illustrate this theorem, here is a possible low crossing num-\nber Legendrian knot to examine as \u039b\u2212. Consider the topological knot 61 which\nis slice and ribbon. Its maximum tb Legendrian representative \u039b61 (see Fig-\nure 19) has tb = \u22125 and r = 0. The DGA of this Legendrian A(\u039b61) admits\nan augmentation, and thus \u039b61 does not admit a Lagrangian cap; see obstruc-\ntions (6) in Section 2.3. Since we are trying to construct a Legendrian \u039b\u2212 that\ncould be Lagrangian concordant to a stabilized unknot, which might have a\nLagrangian cap, we will add some stabilizations that will prevent augmenta-\ntions and thereby allow the possibility of a Lagrangian cap. If we now add a\npositive and a negative stabilization to \u039b61, we get a knot \u039b\u00b1\n61 with tb = \u22127\nand r = 0, which has no augmentation and is still topologically the knot 61.\nIf, by a sequence of moves in Section 3, one can construct a concordance from\n\u039b\u00b1\n61 to the tb = \u22127 stabilized unknot, then by Theorem 14 this Lagrangian\nconcordance will not be decomposable; see Figure 20. In fact, one can stabilize\n\u039b61 as many times as we wish resulting in tb(\u039b\u2212) = t and r(\u039b\u2212) = r and try,\nusing the combinatorial constructions of Section 3, to construct a Lagrangian\nconcordance to \u039b+, where \u039b+ is a Legendrian unknot with tb(\u039b+) = t and\nr(\u039b+) = r. If possible, such a construction would prove the existence of a\nnon-decomposable Lagrangian concordance.\nFigure 19. Front diagram of \u039b61.\nThere are additional results from topology that give obstructions to the\nexistence of ribbon concordances. For example, as shown by Gilmer [Gil84]\nand generalized by Friedl and Powell [FPar], if K\u2212 is ribbon concordant to\nCONSTRUCTIONS OF LAGRANGIAN COBORDISMS\n21\nFigure 20. Any Lagrangian concordance from the doubly sta-\nbilized \u039b61 to the tb = \u22127, r = 0 Legendrian unknot would\nnecessarily be non-decomposable.\nK+, then the Alexander polynomial of K\u2212 divides the Alexander polynomial\nof K+. We can invoke these results in a strategy to show the existence of\nnon-decomposable Lagrangian concordances.\nStrategy 2.\n(1) Use results from smooth topology to \ufb01nd examples of smooth\nknots K\u00b1 such that K\u2212 is not ribbon concordant to K+.\n(2) For any pair of Legendrian representatives \u039b\u00b1 of the knot type K\u00b1,\neven highly stabilized, use a combination of the combinatorial moves\ndescribed in Section 3 to construct a Lagrangian concordance from \u039b\u2212\nto \u039b+.\nThe example with the knot 61 given above is a concrete example to try\nto apply this strategy with K\u2212 = 61 and K+ being an unknot. A possible\nexample when K+ is non-trivial is the following.\nExample 16. Let K\u2212 be the connect sum of the right- and left-handed tre-\nfoils, K\u2212 = Tr#Tl, and let K+ be the connect sum of the \ufb01gure 8 knot with\nitself, K+ = F8#F8. These knots are concordant but there is no ribbon concor-\ndance from K\u2212 to K+, as \ufb01rst shown by Gordon [Gor81]. Choose Legendrian\nrepresentatives \u039b\u00b1 of K\u00b1 such that tb(\u039b\u2212) = tb(\u039b+) and r(\u039b\u2212) = r(\u039b+); note\nthat \u039b\u00b1 can be very stabilized. If we can construct a Lagrangian concordance\nfrom \u039b\u2212 to \u039b+, via the combinatorial moves of Section 3, then we will have\nshown the existence of a pair of Legendrians that are (exactly, orientably) La-\ngrangian concordant but cannot be connected by a decomposable Lagrangian\nconcordance.\nRemark 8. Some known obstructions to ribbon concordance are, in fact, ob-\nstructions to generalizations of ribbon concordance, namely strong homo-\ntopy ribbon concordance and homotopy ribbon concordance. A strong\nhomotopy ribbon concordance is one whose complement is ribbon, i.e., can be\nbuilt with only 1-handles and 2-handles. A homotopy ribbon concordance\nfrom K\u2212 to K+ is a concordance where the induced map on \u03c01 of the comple-\nment of K\u2212 (resp. K+) injects (resp. surjects) into \u03c01 of the complement of\nthe concordance. Gordon [Gor81] showed that\nribbon concordant\n=\u21d2\nstrong homotopy ribbon concordant\n=\u21d2\nhomotopy ribbon concordant.\n22\nCONSTRUCTIONS OF LAGRANGIAN COBORDISMS\nThere have been a number of recent results obstructing (homotopy or strong\nhomotopy) ribbon concordances from Heegaard-Floer and Khovanov homol-\nogy [Zem19, LZ19, MZer, GL20]; these results play an important role in Strat-\negy 2.\n5.3. Candidates for Non-decomposable Lagrangian Cobordisms from\nGRID Invariants. Some candidates for non-decomposable Lagrangian cobor-\ndisms of higher genus come from knot Floer homology. Using the grid formu-\nlation of knot Floer homology [OST08], Ozsv\u00b4ath, Szab\u00b4o, and Thurston de\ufb01ned\nLegendrian invariants of a Legendrian link \u039b \u2282 R3, called GRID invariants,\nwhich are elements in the hat \ufb02avor of knot Floer homology of \u039b \u2282 \u2212S3:\n\ufffd\u03bb+(\u039b), \ufffd\u03bb\u2212(\u039b) \u2208 \ufffd\nHFK(\u2212S3, \u039b).\nFor more background, see [OST08, MOS09].\nBaldwin, Lidman, and Wong [BLWar] have shown that these GRID in-\nvariants can be used to obstruct the existence of decomposable Lagrangian\ncobordisms.\nTheorem 17 ([BLWar, Theorem 1.2] ). Suppose that \u039b\u00b1 are Legendrian links\nin R3 such that either\n(1) \ufffd\u03bb+(\u039b+) = 0 and \ufffd\u03bb+(\u039b\u2212) \u0338= 0, or\n(2) \ufffd\u03bb\u2212(\u039b+) = 0 and \ufffd\u03bb\u2212(\u039b\u2212) \u0338= 0.\nThen there is no decomposable Lagrangian cobordism from \u039b\u2212 to \u039b+.\nRemark 9. By [BVVV13], in the standard contact manifold R3, the GRID\ninvariants agree with the LOSS invariant [LOSS09]. The LOSS invariant is\nfunctorial on Lagrangian concordances by [BS18, BSar]. Thus Theorem 17\nwould also obstruct the existence of general Lagrangian concordances and\nnot only the decomposable ones. To \ufb01nd non-decomposable cobordisms using\nobstructions from [BLWar], we should focus on non-zero genus cobordisms.\nUsing the facts that the GRID invariants are non-zero for the tb = \u22121 Leg-\nendrian unknot and that \ufffd\u03bb+(\u039b+) (resp. \ufffd\u03bb\u2212(\u039b+)) vanish for positively (nega-\ntively) stabilized Legendrian links, Theorem 17 gives the following corollary.\nCorollary 18 ([BLWar, Corollaries 1.3, 1.4]).\n(1) If \u039b \u2282 R3 is a Legen-\ndrian link such that \ufffd\u03bb+(\u039b) = 0 or \ufffd\u03bb\u2212(\u039b) = 0, then there is no decom-\nposable Lagrangian \ufb01lling of \u039b.\n(2) Suppose \u039b\u00b1 are Legendrian links such that either\n(a) \ufffd\u03bb+(\u039b\u2212) \u0338= 0 and \u039b+ is the positive stabilization of a Legendrian\nlink, or\n(b) \ufffd\u03bb\u2212(\u039b\u2212) \u0338= 0 and \u039b+ is the negative stabilization of a Legendrian\nlink.\nThen there is no decomposable Lagrangian cobordism from \u039b\u2212 to \u039b+.\nThis provides another strategy to show the existence of Legendrians \u039b\u00b1\nthat are Lagrangian cobordant but cannot be connected by a decomposable\nLagrangian cobordism.\nCONSTRUCTIONS OF LAGRANGIAN COBORDISMS\n23\nStrategy 3.\n(1) Find Legendrians \u039b\u00b1 satisfying the GRID invariants con-\nditions of Corollary 18 and Theorem 17 such that there are no known\nobstructions, as described in Section 2.3, to the existence of a La-\ngrangian cobordism from \u039b\u2212 to \u039b+.\n(2) Use a combination of the combinatorial moves described in Section 3\nto construct a Lagrangian cobordism from \u039b\u2212 to \u039b+.\nExample 19. Concrete examples mentioned in [BLWar, Section 4.1] can be\nused for Strategy 3. Let \u039b0, \u039b1 be the Legendrian m(10132) knots and Legen-\ndrian m(12n200) knots shown in [NOT08, Figures 2 and 3]. Modify them with\na pattern shown in [BLWar, Figure 13] to get \u039b\u2032\n0 and \u039b\u2032\n1, which are of knot\ntype m(12n199) and m(14n5047) (or its mirror), respectively. For i, j = 0, 1\nwe have tb(\u039b\u2032\ni) = tb(\u039bi) + 2 and r(\u039b\u2032\ni) = r(\u039bi). There is no decomposable\nLagrangian cobordism from\n(1) \u039b0 to \u039b\u2032\n1, or\n(2) \u039b1 to \u039b\u2032\n0.\nIf we can construct, using the combinatorial techniques of Section 3, a La-\ngrangian cobordism (necessarily of genus 1) from \u039b0 to \u039b\u2032\n1 or from \u039b1 to \u039b\u2032\n0,\nthen we will have found a non-decomposable Lagrangian cobordisms.\nExample 20. In [BLWar, Section 4.3], the authors provide an in\ufb01nite fam-\nily of pairs of Legendrian knots where there does not exist a decomposable\nLagrangian cobordism between them.\nRemark 10. In Strategies 2 and 3, we emphasized the construction of La-\ngrangian cobordisms using the combinatorial techniques of Section 3. It would\nbe interesting to know if the geometric constructions of Section 4 could also\nbe used to show the existence of a Lagrangian concordance/cobordism from\nthe theory of normal rulings, topology, or grid invariants, that are known to\nnot be decomposable.\n5.4. Non-decomposable Candidates through Surgery. An additional\nstrategy to show the existence of a non-decomposable Lagrangian \ufb01lling comes\nfrom understanding properties of the contact manifold that is obtained from\nsurgery on the Legendrian knot. In particular, Conway, Etnyre, and Tosun\n[CETar] have detected a relationship between Lagrangian \ufb01llings of a Legen-\ndrian and symplectic \ufb01llings of the contact manifold obtained by performing\na particular type of surgery on the Legendrian.\nTheorem 21 ([CETar, Theorem 1.1]). There is a Lagrangian disk \ufb01lling of\n\u039b+ if and only if the contact +1-surgery on \u039b+ \u2282 R3 \u2282 S3 produces a contact\nmanifold that is strongly symplectically \ufb01llable.\nIf \u039b+ has a decomposable\nLagrangian \ufb01lling, then the \ufb01lling can be taken to be Stein.\nIn fact, [CETar] also shows that a \ufb01lling will be a Stein \ufb01lling if and only\nif \u039b+ bounds a regular Lagrangian disk: a Lagrangian disk is regular if there\nis a Liouville vector \ufb01eld that is tangent to the disk.\nAny decomposable\nLagrangian \ufb01lling is regular.\n24\nCONSTRUCTIONS OF LAGRANGIAN COBORDISMS\nWe now see another strategy to construct a non-decomposable Lagrangian\n\ufb01lling.\nStrategy 4. Find a Legendrian \u039b such that the +1-surgery on \u039b produces a\ncontact manifold that is strongly symplectically \ufb01llable but does not admit a\nStein \ufb01lling.\nAn issue with this approach is a lack of examples: there are very few man-\nifolds which carry strongly \ufb01llable but not Stein \ufb01llable contact structures.\nThe main examples are the 1/n surgeries on the positive and negative trefoils;\nsee works by Ghiggini [Ghi05] and Tosun [Tos20]. However it is not obvi-\nous whether any of these contact structures are a contact +1 surgery on a\nLegendrian knot in S3.\n6. Conclusion\nThe desire to understand the \ufb02exibility and rigidity of Lagrangian submani-\nfolds has led to a great deal of interesting research in symplectic topology. Sim-\nilarly, trying to understand constructions of and obstructions to Lagrangian\ncobordisms has led to many interesting results. At this point, we have few\nconcrete answers to the Motivating Questions stated in our Introduction. In\nparticular, regarding Motivating Question (1), there are presently many can-\ndidates for Legendrians \u039b\u00b1 that can be connected by a Lagrangian cobordism\nbut not by a decomposable Lagrangian cobordism: by understanding all the\nobstructions to Lagrangian cobordisms, one can come up with some good\ncandidates. When trying and failing to construct a Lagrangian cobordism\nbetween a given pair, one may gain intuition for additional obstructions to\nLagrangian cobordisms that are waiting to be discovered.\n",
