foundation of china no no mail phwang edu where h\u03bb \u03bbh and rn rn rn belong to with yh zh zh for the above problem is stochastic counterpart of the classical eigenvalue_problem of mechanic systems see remark the latest progress in this topic can be found in the stochastic_hamiltonian_system was originally introduced in the optimal control theory as necessary condition for optimality are pi er results in this topic the eigenvalue_problem of stochastic_hamiltonian_system is closely_related to the solvability of forward backward stochastic di\ufb00erential equations fbsdes in short about which there are mainly methods in literature the contraction mapping method which is local result to some ent and uniform estimation is necessary if wants to obtain global results the decoupling method which always appears whenever fbsdes and pdes are linked the method based on see also the comments and references in the monograph chapter in addition to the monotonicity condition the method of decoupling for linear fbsdes also plays an important role in this paper see lemma and the comments there similar idea appears in section and chapter note that the eigenvalue_problem for the stochastic_hamiltonian_system with boundary_conditions is di\ufb00erent from and much more complicated than its counterpart in deterministic framework since the eigenfunctions in stochastic case should be progressively measurable most of the techniques in dealing with deterministic eigenvalue_problem do not work anymore in particular it is totally di\ufb00erent from the associated deterministic system by taking expectation directly which can be observed from the example in in considered the following eigenvalue_problem h\u03bb_h\u03bb h\u03bb dt h\u03bb_h\u03bb h\u03bb dbt h\u03bb_h\u03bb h\u03bb dt where h\u03bb and are constant matrices moreover h\u03bb and for dimensional case when proved the following theorem theorem under assumption and condition all the eigenvalues \u03bbm of are positive and \u03bbm as moreover all the eigenspaces associated with each \u03bbm are dimensional based on the above theorem by rather exhaustive analysis we obtained in the following theorem theorem under the same assumptions in theorem let \u03bbm be the eigenvalues then \u03bbm as in detail lim \u03bbm lim \u03bbm remark recall the following eigenvalue_problem of special hamiltonian_system in deterministic framework dt \u03bby dt its eigenvalues are from the theoretical value aspect the conclusions in theorem and theorem for stochastic systems can be considered as an analogue as corollary of theorem we have proposition corollary let be an eigenvalue of the stochastic_hamiltonian_system in theorem then for su\ufb03ciently_large if resp the statistic_period of the associate eigenfunctions the solutions of fbsdes is less resp greater than in this paper we study the eigenvalue_problem in dimensional case with time_dependent coe\ufb03cients \u03bbh dt dbt dt where the following theorems detailed content of which are given in theorem theorem and theorem are the main results in this paper the technical ingredients of their proof consist of legendre_transformation the method of decoupling for fbsdes several concrete kinds of comparison theorems constructing proper auxiliary systems analyzing the blow_up time of associated riccati equations and many other elementary tools in ode theory theorem let \u03bbb be positive constant de\ufb01ned in under assumption there exists \u03bbm \u03bbb all those eigenvalues of problem contained in \u03bbb satisfying \u03bbm as besides the eigenspace associated with each \u03bbm is of dimension moreover \u03bbm as it is worth noting that the results in theorem in addition to its theoretical value together with proposition can be utilized to estimate the statistic_period of solutions of fbsdes directly by its time_dependent coe\ufb03cients and time duration theorem let \u03bbm be an eigenvalue in theorem then for su\ufb03ciently_large_\u02c6h \u02c7h \u02c6h \u02c7h \u03bbm \u02c7h \u02c6h therefore if \u02c7h \u02c6h resp \u02c6h \u02c7h \u02c6h \u02c7h the statistic_period of the eigenfunctions associated with is greater resp less than the eigenvalue_problem for the stochastic_hamiltonian_system with time_dependent coe\ufb03cients is much more complicated than the time independent coe\ufb03cients case because in the latter case by all the eigenvalues come from the blow_up of the associated riccati_equation and dual_riccati_equation however for the time_dependent coe\ufb03cients case the example in section shows that some eigenvalues appear when the solution of the riccati_equation does not blow_up in this paper is used to denote the part of solution to the riccati_equation and the index of eigenvalues is used to denote both the dimension of hamiltonian_system and the index in we believe that it will not cause ambiguity similar results of this paper hold for the eigenvalue_problem of stochastic_hamiltonian_system driven by poisson processes in order to keep this paper in suitable length we postp those results to another paper the paper is organized as follows in section several lemmata are introduced which will be used repeatedly in section the main problem in this paper is formulated in section we prove the existence of all the eigenvalues located in \u03bbb and then all the eigenvalues in under some sharper conditions in section moreover the increasing order of these are studyed in section most importantly apart from its theoretical value as an interesting application this result can be utilized to obtain an estimation about statistic_period of solutions of fbsdes which is investigated in section in section by concrete example we show how the eigenvalue_problem of stochastic_hamiltonian_system with time_dependent coe\ufb03cients is far more subtler than its time independent counterpart at last several examples the proof of several lemmata the review of the viewpoint from functional analysis and legendre_transformation are gathered in the preliminaries comparison theorems let denote the set of all symmetric matrices and the set of all nonnegative matrices in for means that is positive_de\ufb01nite while strictly positive_de\ufb01nite given nonlinear value odes for dki dt kia ki ckic ri kini ki kid fi ki kid ki where ri ni and fi are locally lipschitz lemma lemma denote by the solution to dt ka if and then moreover if or then lemma lemma assume that ki are the solutions to separately and then lemma assume that and resp denote by the solution to the following equation d\u03c6 dt then resp decoupling method for linear fbsdes by the method introduced in every linear fbsde dt dbt dt kt corresponds to riccati type ode dt kt where riccati_equation is introduced in fantastic manner it transfers the fully coupled fbsdes into decoupled lemma depicts the detail the following lemma is generalization of lemma from constant coe\ufb03cients case to time_dependent coe\ufb03cients case however since the proof is standard we put it in appendix lemma assume that on some interval riccati_equation has solution then stochastic_hamiltonian_system with boundary_conditions has an explicit solution where is solved by dt dbt further for if det in or more weakly there is constant such that in in then the solution to is unique investigation of the coe\ufb03cients of the derived riccati equations since can be rewritten as in condition det in is necessary for the unique existence of solution to lemma let such that in \u03b2in then for and in there is constant such that in kh for we have and in kh in for we have proof since in \u03b2in is invertible and in in it follows that in kh noting that in then in then for in kh for in kh then besides by and \u03b2in we obtain in at \ufb01rst assume that then and hence it follows that for general case and by are invertible and hence ki can be de\ufb01ned by it follows that lim lim besides then is mapping from to monotonicity condition for linear fbsdes with constant coe\ufb03cients without perturbation the classical monotonicity condition is as follows \u03b2i where is constant that is for rn rn rn by taking in \u03b2in \u03b2in \u03b2in besides in this paper we always assume that the monotonicity condition holds true formulation in this section we formulate the eigenvalue_problem \u03bbh dt dbt dt assumption assume that and besides satisfy uniformly for moreover besides and by then by remark let then by remark all the eigenvalues of problem are located in such fact can also be deduced from the following viewpoint from we have then when \u03bbh there is no \ufb01nite blow_up time for solution to by lemma there is negative eigenvalue for the eigenvalue_problem in what follows resp can be seen as continuous functions on with resp as in corresponding to we introduce the following riccati_equation \u03bbh kt and forward sde similar to \u03bbh dt dbt to investigate eigenvalues of we borrow the method in to introduce dual hamiltonian_system about which we give concise introduction in of dt dbt dt whose coe\ufb03cients matrices are as follows \u03bbh \u03bbh where the equality in is from note that the boundary condition in legendre dual transformation is degenerate corresponding to similar to again there is dual_riccati_equation dt kt and forward sde in the form of dt dbt for any in and take kt and kt then by can be simpli\ufb01ed to \u03bbh and can be simpli\ufb01ed to dt \u03bbh notations we give the following notations about the blow_up time of solutions to riccati equations sup lim t\u0581t with respect to and sup lim t\u0581t with respect to from legendre_transformation whenever both of them are not equal to then sup lim t\u0581t and sup lim t\u0581t to simplify the notation we will write resp as resp whenever without confusion the existence of eigenvalues analysing the property of blow_up time of solutions of riccati equations with respect to its parameter plays an important role which is an enhanced version of the idea in however the proofs are more complicated due to the time_dependent coe\ufb03cients lemma the blow_up time of solution to is increasing with respect to besides lim_\u03bb\u0580 proof we \ufb01rstly prove by and there is such that for and by assumption is continuous and then we can choose constants \u02c7h \u02c6h such that \u02c7h \u02c6h denote by the solution to the following equation dt \u03bb\u02c6h since by lemma for since and \u03bbh \u03bb\u02c6h by lemma whence moreover denote by the solution to the following equation dt \u03bb\u02c6h subtracting from dt \u03bb\u02c6h \u02c6h \u02c6h since is bounded for su\ufb03ciently_large_\u02c6h moreover for su\ufb03ciently_large and \u02c6h \u03bb\u02c6h \u03bb\u02c6h \u03bb\u02c6h then for and su\ufb03ciently_large_\u02c6h \u02c6h by lemma whence it follows that for su\ufb03ciently_large moreover is an equation with constant coe\ufb03cients and \u02c6h tan \u03bb\u03b2 \u02c6h then \u03bb\u03b2 \u02c6h from which we get lim_\u03bb\u0580 then lim\u03bb\u0580 which is for any since by lemma and lemma therefore for since is increasing in and lim\u03bb\u0580 we can de\ufb01ne inf set \u03bbb mint ma then obviously \u03bbh \u03bbb lemma following the notations above the blow_up time is continuous and strictly_increasing in \u03bbb proof we prove that is continuous in \u03bbb recall that for \u03bbb the blow_up time satis\ufb01es limt\u0581tk then in there is such that \u03bbh moreover in since \u03bbh further by the continuity of dt and there is such that then for by lagrangian middle value theorem by the continuous dependence of solution to with respect to parameter lim there is \u03b4\u01eb such that for \u03b4\u01eb \u03b4\u01eb then by the de\ufb01nition of on the other_hand choose recall that from legendre_transformation whenever both of them are not besides then we consider with terminal condition dt solution to can be ended to due to its local lipschitz coe\ufb03cients from the continuous dependence of solution to with respect to parameter lim sup for any su\ufb03ciently small have uniform strictly positive lower bound for then there is \u03b4\u01eb such that for \u03b4\u01eb \u03b4\u01eb and then by the de\ufb01nition of from and is continuous in at last we prove that is strictly_increasing with respect to for \u03bbh then by lemma in particular whence consider the following odes with terminal time dt \u03bbh and dt from and \u03bbh by lemma we have in particular and hence for ne we also need the similar results of with respect to the proofs of which are similar to that of lemma and lemma we will write down the proofs in appendix for readers convenience lemma the blow_up time of solution to is increasing in and lim_\u03bb\u0580 since is increasing and lim\u03bb\u0580 we can de\ufb01ne inf lemma following the above notations the blow_up time is continuous and strictly_increasing in \u03bbb to get eigenvalues of we also need property of and in depicted by the following lemmas lemma for denote separately by ki the solution to ki \u03bbh ti ki ti then if \ufb01nite besides is continuous dependent on ti proof by there is such that then by lemma ki ti if then obviously if then by lemma for we have whence that is continuous dependent on ti is from local lipschitz condition of lemma for and \u03bbb assume that ki is separately the solution to dki dt ki \u03bbh ti ki ti then if \ufb01nite besides ki is continuous dependent on ti by when \u03bbb \u03bbh the proof of lemma is similar to that of lemma and is omitted theorem under assumption there exists \u03bbm \u03bbb all those eigenvalues of problem contained in \u03bbb satisfying \u03bbm as moreover the eigenfunction space corresponding to each \u03bbm is of dimension proof at \ufb01rst consider the riccati_equation and take \u03bbh denote by the blow_up time of solution to then by lemma and lemma \u03bbb lim \u03bbb is strictly_increasing and continuous bijective mapping of then consider the dual_riccati_equation and take dt \u03bbh let be the blow_up time of the solution to by lemmas to lim and is strictly_increasing and continuous bijective mapping once it is \ufb01nite for su\ufb03ciently_large then consider the riccati_equation and take \u03bbh let be the blow_up time of solution to then by lemmas to lim and is strictly_increasing continuous bijective mapping once it is \ufb01nite for su\ufb03ciently_large by induction we can de\ufb01ne as above such that for su\ufb03ciently_large since for any \ufb01xed \u03bbb inf inf then there is and \u03bbb such that ti ti it deduces that for the above and further because is strictly_increasing continuous bijective mapping and lim_\u03bb\u0580 there is unique minimal \u03bbb and certain unique minimal such that moreover by lemmata again those functions are also strictly_increasing continuous bijective mapping and lim_\u03bb\u0580 then there is unique \u03bbm \u03bbm such that \u03bbm this derives series of \u03bbm satisfying \u03bbb and \u03bbm we claim that this series of \u03bbm are exactly all the eigenvalues of problem which are contained in \u03bbb to prove the claim for \u03bbm we construct the associated eigenfunctions by the above procedure \u03bbm \u03bbm \u03bbm \u03bbm divide the interval into parts \u03bbm \u03bbm \u03bbm \u03bbm \u03bbm \u03bbm \u03bbm \u03bbm recall that by legendre_transformation whenever both of them are non by the above procedure \u03bbm exists on while \u03bbm exists on and \u03bbm \u03bbm ne we will use lemma to get the eigenfunctions take and solve on with initial value condition dt dbt by and let then ch and it follows that condition holds true by lemma uniquely exist on and in particular we get \u03bbm and similarly we can solve on with initial value condition \u03bbh dt dbt \u03bbm \u03bbm by lemma uniquely exist on and in particular we get \u03bbm \u03bbm then we consider on with initial value condition dt dbt \u03bbm \u03bbm \u03bbm \u03bbm by lemma again uniquely exist on and by induction we can solve on with initial value condition \u03bbh dt dbt \u03bbm \u03bbm where \u03bbm is obtained from the previous step on by lemma uniquely exists on and in particular up to now we get the unique on and the unique on by legendre dual transformation and lemma the triple de\ufb01ned by is exactly the nontrivial solution to corresponding to eigenvalue \u03bbm ne we will show that the space of eigenfunctions associated with each \u03bbm are dimensional by lemma every non trivial solution to satis\ufb01es in taking \u00b5x \u00b5y we get the unique solution by the above procedure on the other_hand \u00b5x \u00b5y \u00b5z is nontrivial solution to satisfying \u00b5y moreover by the uniqueness in lemma \u00b5x \u00b5y \u00b5z that is to say the dimension of eigenfunction space corresponding to each \u03bbm is at last we interpret why there are not other eigenvalues for any \u03bbb \u03bbm by the above procedure and exist in turn on the whole then by lemma corresponding to \u03bbb \u03bbm the eigenvalue_problem has unique solution on the other_hand for any \u03bbb \u03bbm by the above procedure then we have from the following equality then trivial solution is the unique to corresponding to any \u03bbb \u03bbm remark in theorem we can say nothing about those eigenvalues in \u03bbb however in section under some proper additional conditions we can discover all the eigenvalues of problem su\ufb03cient condition to \ufb01nd out all the eigenvalues in theorem under some proper conditions all the eigenvalues of problem located in \u03bbb are discovered on the other_hand the example in section indicates that how subtle cases can be when the coe\ufb03cients are time_dependent and that it is tough problem to \ufb01nd out all the eigenvalues however in this section we will show that under some sharper conditions actually all the eigenvalues in can also be discovered in time_dependent eigenvalue_problem of stochastic_hamiltonian_system with boundary_conditions assumption apart from assumption assume that after taking becomes \u03bbh the following is also considered dt \u03bbh \u03bbb from and then by lemma by subtracting from we have dt \u03bbh \u03bbh \u03bbh since for \u03bbb \u03bbh \u03bbh by lemma \u03bbb \u03bbb \u03bbb then \u03bbb \u03bbb \u03bbb moreover lemma under assumption hence lim \u03bb\u0581 \u03bbb\u03bb proof for \u03bbb then by lemma and then under assumption since for \u03bbb is increasing in there is certain su\ufb03ciently_large \u03bbb \u03bbb such that \u03bbb and for \u03bbb \u03bbh \u03bbb by lhospital formula and assumption \u03bbb arctan \u03bbh \u03bbh which implies that \u03bbb then by \u03bbb then by \u03bbb by \u03bbb hence \u03bbb \u03bbb exists on the whole besides since \u03bbh \u03bbb by lemma \u03bbb \u03bbb then for \u03bbb exist on the whole then by lemma there is non trivial solution to problem corresponding to any \u03bbb there is not any other eigenvalue in \u03bbb of problem and the in is indeed the \ufb01rst positive eigenvalue of in other words theorem under assumption there exists \u03bbm all those eigenvalues of problem satisfying \u03bbm as moreover the eigenfunction space corresponding to each \u03bbm is dimensional the order of growth for the eigenvalues of problem for the eigenvalues in theorem furthermore we have the following theorem under the same conditions of theorem let be all the eigenvalues of problem located in \u03bbb then \u03bbm as proof for and denote by \u02c7\u03d5 and \u02c6\u03d5 the constants satisfying \u02c7h \u02c6h \u02c7h \u02c6h \u02c7h \u02c6h \u02c7h \u02c6h \u02c7h \u02c6h \u02c7h \u02c6h besides we may assume that \u02c6h \u02c7h \u02c6h \u02c7h \u02c6h \u02c7h the proof is divided into steps step we will prove that there are \u02c7\u03bbm such that \u03bbm \u02c7\u03bbm and \u02c7\u03bbm as it is easy to verify that matrix \u02c7h \u02c7h \u02c7h \u02c7h \u02c7h \u02c7h \u02c7h \u02c7h \u02c6h satis\ufb01es the assumption in theorem we consider the following eigenvalue_problem of timeindependent coe\ufb03cients \u02c7h \u02c7h \u03bb\u02c6h \u02c7h \u02c7h dt \u02c7h \u02c7h \u02c6h dbt \u02c7h \u02c7h \u02c7h dt denote by

time_dependent case when is not large enough or perturbation is degenerate things can be quite subtle we show how situation goes di\ufb00erent by the following meticulous example consider

corresponding eigenfunctions can be constructed as follows solve stochastic di\ufb00erential equation with initial condition dt dbt where is continuous and bounded on then we get on and let then solve the following equation dt dbt where is continuous and bounded on then we get on and moreover eigenfunction comes from the similar method in remark in the case depicted by this example eigenvalue emerges when corresponding solution to dual_riccati_equation get back to rather than blowing up to this case is beyond the scope of and this paper to characterize the property of and in is far from easy further study demands new methods example denying the naive expectation example in assume that and then the eigenvalue_problem is rewritten as dt dbt dt on hand since is negative by section all the eigenvalues of should be positive on the other_hand apparently for the coe\ufb03cient matrix of satis\ufb01es the monotonicity condition there is constant such that for any by proposition the solution of is unique which is then any is not an eigenvalue of problem now if feasible by taking expectation on the stochastic_hamiltonian_system we have the following ode with points boundary_conditions de dt de dt assume and let then obviously all the are eigenvalues of this means that we can not study the eigenvalue_problem of stochastic_hamiltonian_system merely by taking

    "Abstract_Original": ": In this paper we solve the eigenvalue problem of stochastic Hamiltonian system\nwith boundary conditions. Firstly, we extend the results in S. Peng [12] from time-invariant\ncase to time-dependent case, proving the existence of a series of eigenvalues {\u03bbm} and construct\ncorresponding eigenfunctions.\nMoreover, the order of growth for these {\u03bbm} are obtained:\n\u03bbm \u223c m2, as m \u2192 +\u221e. As applications, we give an explicit estimation formula about the\nstatistic period of solutions of Forward-Backward SDEs. Besides, by a meticulous example we\nshow the subtle situation in time-dependent case that some eigenvalues appear when the solution\nof the associated Riccati equation does not blow-up, which does not happen in time-invariant\ncase.\nKeywords: Eigenvalue problem; Forward-Backward SDE; Stochastic Hamiltonian system; Mono-\ntonicity condition; Statistic period; Method of decoupling; Riccati equation.\n2020 AMS MSC: 60H10; 34B99; 34F05; 34L15.",
