lagrangian cobordism can be related by ribbon lagrangian cobordism in particular that is decomposable into composition of these elementary building blocks we will describe these and other combinatorial building blocks as well as some geometric methods involving the theory of satellites to construct lagrangian cobordisms we will then survey some known results derived through heegaard homology and contact surgery that may provide pathway to proving the existence of nondecomposable nonribbon lagrangian cobordisms introduction contact manifold is an odd dimensional manifold together with maximally non integrable hyperplane distribution in contact manifold legendrian submanifolds play central role these are the maximal integral submanifolds of \u03bbn such that for all in general legendrian submanifolds are plentiful and easy to construct in this article we will restrict our attention to the contact manifold with its standard contact structure ker where in this setting every smooth knot or link has an in\ufb01nite number of non equivalent legendrian representatives more background on legendrian knots is given in the even dimensional siblings of contact manifolds are symplectic manifolds these are even dimensional manifolds equipped with closed non degenerate form in symplectic manifolds lagrangian submanifolds play central role lagrangian submanifolds are the maximal dimensional submanifolds where vanishes on the tangent spaces such that when the symplectic manifold is exact d\u03bb it is important to understand the more restrictive subset of exact lagrangians these are submanifolds where is an exact form geometrically exact means that for any closed curve in this article we will restrict our attention to symplectic manifold that is symplectomorphic to with its standard symplectic structure in contrast to legendrians lagrangians are scarce for math dec constructions of lagrangian cobordisms example in with its standard symplectic structure the torus is the only closed surface that will admit lagrangian embedding into famous theorem of gromov gro states that there are no closed exact lagrangian submanifolds of there has been great deal of recent interest in certain class of non closed exact lagrangian submanifolds known as lagrangian cobordisms these lagrangian submanifolds live in the symplectization of contact manifold and have cylindrical ends over legendrians in this article we will focus on exact orientable lagrangian cobordisms from the legendrian to the legendrian that live in the symplectization of this symplectization is equipped with the exact symplectic form et\u03b1 where is the coordinate on and is the standard contact form on see figure for schematic picture of lagrangian cobordism and de\ufb01nition for formal de\ufb01nition such lagrangian cobordisms were \ufb01rst introduced in symplectic field theory sft egh in relative sft we get category whose objects are legendrians and whose morphisms are lagrangian cobordisms lagrangian \ufb01llings occur when and are key objects in the fukaya category which is an important invariant of symplectic manifolds lagrangian cap occurs when basic question tied to understanding the general existence and behavior of lagrangian submanifolds is to understand the existence of lagrangian cobordisms given legendrians when does there exist lagrangian cobordism from to there are known to be number of obstructions to this relation on legendrian submanifolds coming from both classical and non classical invariants of the legendrians some of these obstructions are described in to complement the obstructions there are some known constructions for example it is well known cha that there exists lagrangian cobordism between legendrians that differ by legendrian isotopy in addition by cha it is known that there exists lagrangian cobordism from to if can be obtained from by pinch move or if where denotes legendrian unknot with maximal thurston bennequin number of that is contained in the complement of ball containing topologically between these slices the cobordism changes by saddle move handle and the addition of local minimum handle see figure it is important to notice that there is not an elementary move corresponding to local maximum handle move by stacking these individual cobordisms obtained from isotopy saddles and minimums obtains what is commonly referred to as decomposable lagrangian cobordism through these moves it is easy to construct lagrangian cobordisms and \ufb01llings see an example in figure towards understanding the existence of lagrangians it is natural to ask does there exist lagrangian cobordism from to if and only if there exists decomposable lagrangian cobordism from to we know the answer to this question is no by studying the movies of the not necessarily constructions of lagrangian cobordisms figure the pinch move on produces lagrangian saddle obtained by introducing an unknotted comp nt to corresponds to the lagrangian cobordism having local min legendrian slices of lagrangian sauvaget murphy and lin sau lin have shown that there exists genus lagrangian cap of the legendrian unknot with thurston bennequin number equal to and rotation number the lagrangian diagram moves used by lin to construct lagrangian cap are described in section the necessity of local maximum when is not currently understood to formulate some precise motivating questions we will use ribbon cobordism to denote dimensional manifold that can be built from handles with this idea of restricting the handle index is well known in symplectic topology eliashberg ce oan has shown that any dimensional stein manifold admits handle decomposition with handles of dimension at most and thus any dimensional stein cobordism between closed dimensional contact manifolds must be ribbon working in the relative setting with submanifolds and using the handle decomposition from the height function given by the coordinate on we see that all decomposable dimensional lagrangian cobordisms between dimensional legendrian submanifolds are ribbon cobordisms we are led to the following natural questions motivating questions suppose and there exists connected lagrangian cobordism from to then does there exist decomposable lagrangian cobordism from to does there exist ribbon lagrangian cobordism from to is lagrangian isotopic to ribbon and or decomposable lagrangian cobordism there are some results known about motivating question for the special case of the simplest legendrian unknot if denotes the legendrian unknot with thurston bennequin number it is known that every exact lagrangian \ufb01lling is orientable rit and there is unique exact orientable lagrangian \ufb01lling of up to compactly supported hamiltonian constructions of lagrangian cobordisms isotopy ep moreover any lagrangian cobordism from to is lagrangian isotopic via compactly supported hamiltonian isotopy to in countable collection given by the trace of legendrian isotopy induced by rotation motivating questions and are closely related and have deep ties to important questions in topology observe that yes answer to implies yes to if the existence of lagrangian cobordism implies the existence of decomposable lagrangian cobordism then we also know the existence of ribbon cobordism also note that when is topologically slice knot and is symplectic version of the topological slice ribbon conjecture is every lagrangian slice disk ribbon disk cornwell ng and sivek conjecture that the answer to motivating question and is no using the theory of satellites we know that there is lagrangian concordance between shown in figure and in conjecture it is conjectured that the concordance between the pair is not decomposable figure there is lagrangian concordance between these legendrian knots that is conjectured to be non decomposable here is legendrian trefoil and is legendrian whitehead double of very recently has discovered additional combinatorial moves that can be used to construct movie meaning sequence of slice pictures of lagrangian cobordism figure illustrates of these tangle moves with of guadagnis moves it is possible to construct movie of lagrangian cobordism between the legendrians pictured in figure see figure guadagnis moves are geometric they are developed through proofs similar to those used in the satellite procedure and thus the handle attachments involved in the cobordism are not obvious in particular at this constructions of lagrangian cobordisms point it is not known if guadagnis tangle moves are independent from the decomposable moves this survey article is organized as follows in we provide some background on legendrians and lagrangians formally de\ufb01ne lagrangian cobordisms and summarize known obstructions to the existence of lagrangian cobordisms in section we describe combinatorial ways to construct lagrangian cobordisms and in section we describe more abstract geometric ways to construct lagrangian concordances and cobordisms through satellites then in section we describe some potential pathways through the theory of rulings heegaard homology and contact surgery to potentially show the existence of legendrians that are lagrangian cobordant but are not related by decomposable lagrangian cobordism acknowledgements this project was initiated at the workshop women in symplectic and contact geometry and topology wiscon that took place at icerm in july the authors thank the nsf hrd advance grant for funding this workshop leverson was supported by nsf postdoctoral fellowship dms we thank for suggesting and encouraging us to work on this project in addition we thank and bulent tosun for useful conversations related to this project background and links in this section we give very brief introduction to legendrian submanifolds in and their invariants more details can be found for example in the survey paper in the standard contact structure is dimensional plane \ufb01eld given by the kernel of the form in ker legendrian knot is knot in that is tangent to everywhere useful way to visualize legendrian knot is to project it from to there are useful projections the lagrangian projection \u03c0l as well as the front projection \u03c0f an example of legendrian trefoil is shown in figure legendrian submanifolds are equivalent if they can be connected by parameter family of legendrian submanifolds in fact for each topological knot type there are in\ufb01nitely many di\ufb00erent legendrian knots indeed we can stabilize legendrian knot as shown in figure to get another legendrian knot of the same topological knot type we can see that these are not legendrian equivalent using legendrian invariants constructions of lagrangian cobordisms figure the front projection left and the lagrangian projection right of legendrian trefoil figure ways to stabilize legendrian knot in front projection useful classical invariants of legendrian knots are the thurstonbennequin number and the rotation number they can be computed easily from front projections given the front projection of legendrian knot or link the thurston bennequin number is writhe \u03c0f right cusps where the writhe is the number of crossings counted with sign once the legendrian knot is equipped with an orientation the rotation number is down cusps up cusps can use these invariants to see that stabilizations change the legendrian knot type in future sections we will not assume that our legendrians come equipped with an orientation in our motivating questions described in section our lagrangian cobordisms are always orientable so the existence of lagrangian cobordism from to will induce orientations on there are many powerful non classical invariants that can be assigned to legendrian knot although this will not be focus of this paper we will give brief description of some of these invariants important invariant stems from normal rulings de\ufb01ned independently by chekanov and pushkar and fuchs fuc count of normal rulings leads to ruling polynomials more details will be discussed in section through the closely related theory of generating families can also associate invariant polynomials that record the dimensions of generating family homology groups tra fr st in addition through the theory of pseudoholomoprhic curves can associate to legendrian di\ufb00erential graded algebra dga che eli an augmentation is dga map from to \ufb01eld the count of augmentations is closely related to the count constructions of lagrangian cobordisms of ruling polynomials fuc ns augmentations can be used to construct \ufb01nite dimensional linearized contact homology groups che which are often known to be isomorphic to the generating family homology groups fr in addition there are invariants for legendrian knots coming from heegaard homology loss ost lagrangian cobordisms between legendrian submanifolds always have cylindrical ends over the legendrians but other conditions vary sometimes it is speci\ufb01ed that the lagrangian is exact is embedded or immersed is orientable or has \ufb01xed maslov class in this paper lagrangian cobordism is always exact embedded and orientable de\ufb01nition let be legendrian knots or links in ker lagrangian cobordism from to is an embedded orientable lagrangian surface in the symplectization et\u03b1 such that for some is compact and there exists function and constant numbers such that et\u03b1 df where and lagrangian \ufb01lling of is lagrangian cobordism with lagrangian cap of is lagrangian cobordism with lagrangian concordance occurs when are knots and has genus figure is schematic representation of lagrangian cobordism figure lagrangian cobordism from to remark in condition of de\ufb01nition the fact that are legendrian will guarantee that will be locally constant using this it follows that any genus lagrangian surface that is cylindrical over legendrian knots will be exact when have multiple comp nts needs to check that the constant does not vary this condition guarantees the exactness of the constructions of lagrangian cobordisms lagrangian cobordism obtained by gluing together lagrangian cobordisms cha remark in contrast to topological cobordisms lagrangian cobordisms form non symmetric relationship on legendrian knots cha in this article we will always denote the direction of increasing rt coordinate by an arrow obstructions to the focus of this paper is on constructing lagrangian cobordisms between given legendrians in the smooth world any knots are related by smooth cobordism but in this more restrictive lagrangian world there are number of obstructions that are important to keep in mind when trying to explicitly construct lagrangian cobordisms here we mention few that come from classical and non classical invariants of the legendrians obstructions if there exists lagrangian cobordism of genus between and then there must exist smooth cobordism of genus between the smooth knot types of and thus any obstruction of smooth genus cobordism between and would obstruct lagrangian genus cobordism since there are no closed exact lagrangian surfaces gro if there exists lagrangian cap respectively \ufb01lling for then there cannot exist lagrangian \ufb01lling respectively cap of as shown in cha if there exists lagrangian cobordism from to then and in particular if legendrian knot admits lagrangian \ufb01lling or cap then also combining this equality on and the slice bennequin inequality rud we see that when is single comp nt knot if there exists lagrangian cap of then and if there exists maslov ees lagrangian cobordism from to and has an augmentation then aug aug where is the \ufb01nite \ufb01eld of elements and aug denotes the number of augmentations of to up to dga homotopy pan csll and the ruling polynomials r\u03bb see section for de\ufb01nitions satisfy r\u03bb q\u03c7 r\u03bb for any that is power of prime number pan if admits maslov lagrangian \ufb01lling and if \u03f5l denotes the augmentation of induced by then \u03f5l which is known as the ekholm seidel isomorphism and whose proof was completed by in dr more generally if constructions of lagrangian cobordisms there is cobordism from to and if admits an augmentation then provides several long exact sequences relating the homology of the cobordism and the legendrian contact co homologies of its legendrian ends version of this isomorphism and these long exact sequences using generating families are given in st if admits an augmentation does not admit lagrangian cap as the augmentation implies the non acyclicity of the dga ees theorem and from dr corollary if legendrian admits lagrangian cap then its dga with coe\ufb03cients is acyclic there are additional obstructions obtained through heegaard theory that can be used to obstruct lagrangian concordances and cobordisms bsar some of these will be discussed more in section remark observe that the obstructions in and assume that the bottom has an augmentation and stabilized knots will never have an augmentation it would be nice to have more obstructions when is stabilized knot this might be possible using the theory of satellites described in section it is possible for the satellite of stabilized legendrian to admit an augmentation see section for more discussions in this direction combinatorial constructions of convenient way of visualizing topological cobordisms is through movies sequence of pictures that represent slices of the lagrangian in this section we describe known combinatorial ways to construct lagrangian cobordisms through such an approach it is well known that if and are legendrian isotopic then there exists lagrangian cobordism from to see for example cha isotopy together with types of handle moves form the basis for decomposable lagrangian cobordisms theorem bst if the front diagrams of legendrian links and are related by any of the following moves there is lagrangian cobordism from to isotopy there is legendrian isotopy between and see figures for handle the front diagram of can be obtained from the front diagram of by pinching oppositely oriented strands see figure we will also refer to this move as handle the front diagram of can be obtained from the front diagram of by deleting comp nt of that is the front diagram of standard legendrian unknot with maximal thurston bennequin number of as long as there exist disjoint disks du duc containing the projection of and the other comp nts of respectively such an unknot \ufb01lling can be seen in figure constructions of lagrangian cobordisms figure decomposable moves in terms of front projections arrows indicate the direction of increasing rt coordinate in the symplectization the move in only shows the reidemeister move in the left cusp case but there is an analogous move for the right cusp de\ufb01nition lagrangian cobordism from to is called elementary if it arises from isotopy single handle or single handle lagrangian cobordism from to is decomposable if it is obtained by stacking elementary lagrangian cobordisms observe that there is not an elementary move corresponding to handle maximum also note that the elementary handle saddle move can be used to connect comp nts or to split comp nt into decomposable cobordisms are particularly convenient as they are easy to describe in combinatorial fashion through list of embedded legendrian curves \u03bbn where the front projection of the legendrian \u03bbi is related to that of \u03bbi by isotopy or of the handle or handle moves example can construct lagrangian \ufb01lling of positive legendrian trefoil with maximal thurston bennequin number using the series of moves shown in figure handle followed by reidemeister moves followed by handles or pinch moves this gives genus orientable exact lagrangian \ufb01lling of this legendrian trefoil since we are assuming that lagrangian \ufb01llings and caps are always exact this implies that this trefoil cannot admit lagrangian cap see obstructions example using elementary moves can also construct lagrangian concordance from the unknot with to legendrian representative of the knot as shown on figure very recently has discovered new tangle move see figure this is not local move there are some constructions of lagrangian cobordisms figure decomposable lagrangian \ufb01lling of legendrian trefoil figure decomposable lagrangian cobordism from legendrian unknot to legendrian global requirements in particular this move cannot be applied if all comp nts of the tangle are contained in the same comp nt of the comp nt of containing the blue strand must be di\ufb00erent than the comp nts containing the other strands of the tangle figure under some global conditions there exists lagrangian cobordism between these tangles example with guadagnis tangle move it is possible to construct lagrangian cobordism between the legendrians pictured in figure see figure however at this point it is not known if guadagnis tangle move is independent of the decomposable moves lagrangian diagram moves as shown in section decomposable cobordisms are constructed from handles and some handles saddles but no handles caps based on the work of sauvaget sau lin lin constructs genus cap of twice stabilized unknot and thus gives the \ufb01rst explicit example of non decomposable lagrangian cobordism the construction describes time slices of lagrangian cobordism through list of moves on decorated lagrangian diagrams constructions of lagrangian cobordisms figure movie using guadagni move of an orientable exact lagrangian cobordism from the trefoil to the whitehead double of in figure decorated lagrangian diagram is curve in the plane with the compact regions decorated by positive number which is the area of the region figure shows some examples in the illustration of the move is lagrangian projection of the legendrian unknot with maximal thurstonbennequin number in the illustration of the move um is decorated lagrangian diagram but is not the lagrangian projection of legendrian knot theorem lin let be legendrian links and be their corresponding decorated lagrangian projections if can create sequence of decorated lagrangian diagrams dn such that each diagram di can be obtained from di by the following combinatorial moves then there is compact lagrangian submanifold in with boundary where for some planar isotopy that changes areas by the amount for this operation can only be in the direction speci\ufb01ed reidemeister move can either introduce or eliminate crossings assuming some area conditions are satis\ufb01ed it is possible to introduce or remove crossings as long as the area of the inner region denoted by in the diagram is less than either the area or the area can also do this move with the lower strand passing under the upper strand reidemeister move can perform reidemeister move as long as the area of the inner region denoted by in the diagram is less than either the area the area or the area the \ufb01xed center crossing can be reversed additionally the moving strand can also occur as an overstrand constructions of lagrangian cobordisms um figure the lagrangian diagram moves the labels in move represent the change of area through the move while other labels indicate the area of the corresponding regions here represents positive area that is smaller than either the area the area or the area handle attachment that creates positive crossing in the diagram handle attachment that removes negative crossing in the diagram \ufb01lling that creates the diagram which is the lagrangian projection of an unknot with maximal thurston bennequin number cap that eliminates the diagram um which is the topological mirror of these moves are called lagrangian diagram moves moreover the constructed lagrangian will be exact if in addition each move results in diagram with all comp nts having total signed area equal to the signed area of region is determined by the sum of the signed heights of its chords if handle attachment merges comp nts of link the comp nts being merged must be vertically split meaning that the images of the projections of these comp nts are contained in disjoint disks constructions of lagrangian cobordisms remark for condition the can never be applied to merge comp nts and can only be applied if the comp nts being merged are vertically split main distinction between the lagrangian diagram moves and the decomposable moves is that each diagram di in the middle of the sequence is not necessarily the lagrangian projection of legendrian link they are just the projection of some time ti slice of the cobordism thus the lagrangian diagram moves are more \ufb02exible than the decomposable moves however keeping track of the areas is an added complication example figure illustrates the construction of lagrangian torus using the lagrangian diagram moves this torus fails to be exact since condition is violated figure gives another construction of lagrangian torus this time all comp nts have signed area but now condition is violated figure non exact lagrangian torus constructed using the lagrangian diagram moves the middle \ufb01gure violates figure non exact lagrangian torus constructed using the lagrangian diagram moves these \ufb01gures satisfy but is violated in the step labelled by red arrow constructions of lagrangian cobordisms geometrical constructions of an important general way to know of the existence of lagrangian cobordisms without using the constructions described in section comes through the satellite operation in this section we review the satellite construction and then state results from about the existence of lagrangian concordance cobordism from to implying the existence of lagrangian concordance cobordism between corresponding satellites the legendrian satellite construction we begin by reviewing the construction of legendrian satellite see also nt appendix and to construct legendrian satellite begin by identifying the open solid torus with the jet space of the circle equipped with the contact form where are the coordinates in and is the coordinate in similar to the situation for we can recover legendrian knot in from its front projection in which is typically drawn by representing as an interval with its endpoints identi\ufb01ed given an oriented legendrian companion knot and oriented legendrian pattern knot the legendrian neighborhood theorem says that has standard neighborhood such that there is contactomorphism the legendrian satellite is then the image the front projection of is as shown in figure in particular suppose that the front projection of the pattern intersects the vertical line at the boundary of the interval times we then make an copy of by using disjoint copies of that all di\ufb00er by small translations in the direction take point on the front projection of that is oriented from left to right cut the front of the copy open along the copy at that point and insert the front diagram of the orientation on the satellite is induced by the orientation on figure example of legendrian satellite remark the satellite operation often makes legendrian knots nicer for example in figure the companion is stabilized and does not admit an augmentation or normal ruling however the satellite does admit normal ruling and augmentation constructions of lagrangian cobordisms for in theorem cornwell ng and sivek show that lagrangian concordance is preserved by the legendrian satellite operation theorem is legendrian knot if there exists lagrangian concordance from lengendrian knot to lengendrian knot then there exists lagrangian concordance from to in particular as shown in figure there is lagrangian concordance from which is the legendrian unknot with to which is the legendrian with maximal using the legendrian clasp tangle as shown in figure which produces the legendrian whitehead double we can conclude that there exists lagrangian concordance from to in fact is the positive trefoil with thus theorem implies that there exists lagrangian concordance between the legendrian knots in figure conjecture conjecture the lagrangian concordance from to built through the satellite construction is not decomposable theorem has been extended to higher genus cobordisms by guadagni and yacav in to state their theorem we need to \ufb01rst introduce the notion of twisting and then closing tangle given legendrian tangle is the tangle obtained by adding the tangle and the full twist tangle which is illustrated in figure the tangle tt can be thought of as followed by full twists given legendrian tangle will denote the associated closure to legendrian link figure for an stranded tangle repeating this basic tangle times produces full twist theorem suppose is legendrian tangle whose closure is legendrian knot if there exists lagrangian cobordism from to of genus then there exists lagrangian cobordism lt from to in fact theorem can be generalized to use the closure of di\ufb00erent tangles and that are lagrangian cobordant for details see constructions of lagrangian cobordisms remark it is natural to wonder if along the lines of conjecture this higher genus satellite procedure can create additional candidates for legendrians that can be connected by lagrangian cobordism but not by decomposable lagrangian cobordism in theorem it is shown that if the cobordism from to is decomposable and the handles in the decomposition satisfy conditions known as property then the corresponding satellites and will also be connected by decomposable lagrangian cobordism in particular if there exists decomposable cobordism that does not satisfy property and is not isotopic to cobordism that satis\ufb01es property then the satellite construction would lead to higher genus candidate that generalizes conjecture obstructions to through in some known obstructions to the existence of lagrangian cobordism were menti as menti in remark number of these obstructions require to admit an augmentation and thus in particular must be nonstabilized however as menti in remark it is possible for the satellite of legendrian to admit an augmentation even if does not so the contrapositive of theorem provides potential strategy for further obstructions to the existence of lagrangian cobordism when does not admit an augmentation for example motivated by obstruction in can ask can count of augmentations give an obstruction to the existence of lagrangian concordance from to and thereby obstruct the existence of lagrangian concordance from to in fact this augmentation count will not likely provide further obstruction simple computation shows that when is stabilized enough the number of augmentations of only depends on the legendrian pattern if trying to pursue this path to obtain further obstructions to lagrangian cobordisms it is useful to keep in mind the following result of ng that shows the dga of the satellite of legendrian might only remember the underlying knot type of theorem ng suppose and are stabilized legendrian knots that are of the same topological knot type and have the same thurston bennequin and rotation numbers for legendrian pattern whose front intersects vertical line by points the dgas of and are equivalent candidates for non decomposable now that we have developed some ways to construct lagrangian cobordism through combinatorial moves and satellites we state some theorems that show if lagrangian cobordism does exist then it cannot be decomposable this addresses motivating question while we discuss these theorems it is useful to keep in mind the known obstructions to lagrangian cobordisms that were menti in constructions of lagrangian cobordisms candidates for non decomposable from normal rulings simple way to show that legendrians cannot be connected by decomposable lagrangian cobordism comes from count of combinatorial rulings roughly normal ruling of legendrian is decomposition of the front projection into pairs of paths from left cusps to right cusps such that each pair of paths starts from common left cusp and ends at common right cusp has no further intersections and bounds topological disk whose boundary is smooth everywhere other than at the cusps and certain crossings called switches and near switch the pair of paths must be arranged as in of the diagrams in figure observe that near the switch vertical slices of the associated disks are either disjoint or the slices of are contained in the slices of the other formal de\ufb01nitions of normal rulings can be found in for example and fuc figure normal rulings near switch as an illustration all normal rulings of particular legendrian trefoil are shown in figure figure all normal rulings of this positive legendrian trefoil for each normal ruling let and be the number of switches and number of disks respectively by the ruling polynomial is where the sum is over all the normal rulings is an invariant of under legendrian isotopy normal rulings and augmentations are closely related even though they are de\ufb01ned in very di\ufb00erent ways fuc fi ns sab constructions of lagrangian cobordisms we have the following obstruction to decomposable cobordisms in terms of normal rulings theorem if has normal rulings and has normal rulings with then there is no decomposable lagrangian cobordism from to proof can compare the number of normal rulings of the ends for the decomposable moves as shown in figure thus any normal ruling of induces normal ruling of di\ufb00erent normal rulings of induce di\ufb00erent normal rulings of therefore the number of normal rulings of is bigger than or equal to the number of normal rulings of figure comparison of normal rulings for decomposable moves here is strategy to show the existence of legendrians that can be connected by lagrangian cobordism but not by that is decomposable strategy choose legendrians such that has fewer graded normal rulings than and it is possible to construct via combination of the combinatorial constructions from section or the satellite construction from section lagrangian cobordism from to remark if admit normal rulings they will admit augmentations fi sab from obstructions we then know that if there is lagrangian cobordism from to their ruling polynomials satisfy r\u03bb q\u03c7 r\u03bb for any that is power of prime number satisfying condition in strategy means that the polynomial on the right side of the inequality has fewer terms than the polynomial on the left side of the inequality if following this approach it may be helpful to start by \ufb01rst \ufb01nding pair of positive polynomials that satisfy this inequality and condition at the same time can start with checking the ruling polynomials of small crossing number legendrian knots on candidates for non decomposable lagrangian concordances from topology observe that any decomposable lagrangian concordance will be smooth ribbon concordance thus it is potentially possible to use known obstructions to ribbon concordances to \ufb01nd examples of smooth knots whose legendrian representatives cannot be connected by decomposable lagrangian constructions of lagrangian cobordisms concordance constructing lagrangian concordance between very stabilized legendrian representatives of these knot types via the combinatorial techniques of section or geometric techniques of section will give an example of an exact lagrangian concordance between knots that cannot be connected by decomposable lagrangian concordance for example it is known gor zem that the only knot that admits ribbon concordance to the unknot is the unknot itself this has as corollary the following obstruction to decomposable lagrangian concordance theorem theorem if is topologically non trivial and is topologically an unknot then there is no decomposable lagrangian concordance from to example to illustrate this theorem here is possible low crossing number legendrian knot to examine as consider the topological knot which is slice and ribbon its maximum legendrian representative see figure has and the dga of this legendrian admits an augmentation and thus does not admit lagrangian cap see obstructions in since we are trying to construct legendrian that could be lagrangian concordant to stabilized unknot which might have lagrangian cap we will add some stabilizations that will prevent augmentations and thereby allow the possibility of lagrangian cap if we now add positive and negative stabilization to we get with and which has no augmentation and is still topologically the knot if by sequence of moves in section can construct concordance from to the stabilized unknot then by theorem this lagrangian concordance will not be decomposable see figure in fact can stabilize as many times as we wish resulting in and and try using the combinatorial constructions of section to construct lagrangian concordance to where is legendrian unknot with and if possible such construction would prove the existence of non decomposable lagrangian concordance figure front diagram of there are additional results from topology that give obstructions to the existence of ribbon concordances for example as shown by gilmer gil and generalized by friedl and powell fpar if is ribbon concordant to constructions of lagrangian cobordisms figure any lagrangian concordance from the doubly stabilized to the legendrian unknot would necessarily be non decomposable then the alexander polynomial of divides the alexander polynomial of we can invoke these results in strategy to show the existence of non decomposable lagrangian concordances strategy use results from smooth topology to \ufb01nd examples of smooth knots such that is not ribbon concordant to for any pair of legendrian representatives of the knot type even highly stabilized use combination of the combinatorial moves described in section to construct lagrangian concordance from to the example with the knot given above is concrete example to try to apply this strategy with and being an unknot possible example when is non trivial is the following example let be the connect sum of the right and left handed trefoils tr and let be the connect sum of the \ufb01gure knot with itself these knots are concordant but there is no ribbon concordance from to as \ufb01rst shown by gordon gor choose legendrian representatives of such that and note that can be very stabilized if we can construct lagrangian concordance from to via the combinatorial moves of section then we will have shown the existence of pair of legendrians that are exactly orientably lagrangian concordant but cannot be connected by decomposable lagrangian concordance remark some known obstructions to ribbon concordance are in fact obstructions to generalizations of ribbon concordance namely strong homotopy ribbon concordance and homotopy ribbon concordance strong homotopy ribbon concordance is whose complement is ribbon can be built with only handles and handles homotopy ribbon concordance from to is concordance where the induced map on of the complement of resp injects resp surjects into of the complement of the concordance gordon gor showed that ribbon concordant strong homotopy ribbon concordant homotopy ribbon concordant constructions of lagrangian cobordisms there have been number of recent results obstructing homotopy or strong homotopy ribbon concordances from heegaard and khovanov homology zem gl these results play an important role in strategy candidates for non decomposable from grid invariants some candidates for non decomposable lagrangian cobordisms of higher genus come from knot homology using the grid formulation of knot homology ost and thurston de\ufb01ned legendrian invariants of legendrian link called grid invariants which are elements in the hat \ufb02avor of knot homology of for more background see ost mos baldwin lidman and wong have shown that these grid invariants can be used to obstruct the existence of decomposable lagrangian cobordisms theorem theorem suppose that are legendrian links in such that either and or and then there is no decomposable lagrangian cobordism from to remark by in the standard contact manifold the grid invariants agree with the loss invariant loss the loss invariant is functorial on lagrangian concordances by bs bsar thus theorem would also obstruct the existence of general lagrangian concordances and not only the decomposable to \ufb01nd non decomposable cobordisms using obstructions from we should focus on non genus cobordisms using the facts that the grid invariants are non for the legendrian unknot and that resp vanish for positively negatively stabilized legendrian links theorem gives the following corollary corollary corollaries if is legendrian link such that or then there is no decomposable lagrangian \ufb01lling of suppose are legendrian links such that either and is the positive stabilization of legendrian link or and is the negative stabilization of legendrian link then there is no decomposable lagrangian cobordism from to this provides another strategy to show the existence of legendrians that are lagrangian cobordant but cannot be connected by decomposable lagrangian cobordism constructions of lagrangian cobordisms strategy find legendrians satisfying the grid invariants conditions of corollary and theorem such that there are no known obstructions as described in to the existence of lagrangian cobordism from to use combination of the combinatorial moves described in section to construct lagrangian cobordism from to example concrete examples menti in section can be used for strategy let be the legendrian knots and legendrian knots shown in not figures and modify them with pattern shown in figure to get and which are of knot type and or its mirror respectively for we have \u03bbi and \u03bbi there is no decomposable lagrangian cobordism from to or to if we can construct using the combinatorial techniques of section lagrangian cobordism necessarily of genus from to or from to then we will have found non decomposable lagrangian cobordisms example in section the authors provide an in\ufb01nite family of pairs of legendrian knots where there does not exist decomposable lagrangian cobordism between them remark in strategies and we emphasized the construction of lagrangian cobordisms using the combinatorial techniques of section it would be interesting to know if the geometric constructions of section could also be used to show the existence of lagrangian concordance cobordism from the theory of normal rulings topology or grid invariants that are known to not be decomposable non decomposable candidates through surgery an additional strategy to show the existence of non decomposable lagrangian \ufb01lling comes from understanding properties of the contact manifold that is obtained from surgery on the legendrian knot in particular and have detected relationship between lagrangian \ufb01llings of legendrian and symplectic \ufb01llings of the contact manifold obtained by performing particular type of surgery on the legendrian theorem cetar theorem there is lagrangian disk \ufb01lling of if and only if the contact surgery on produces contact manifold that is strongly symplectically \ufb01llable if has decomposable lagrangian \ufb01lling then the \ufb01lling can be taken to be stein in fact cetar also shows that \ufb01lling will be stein \ufb01lling if and only if bounds regular lagrangian disk lagrangian disk is regular if there is vector \ufb01eld that is tangent to the disk any decomposable lagrangian \ufb01lling is regular constructions of lagrangian cobordisms we now see another strategy to construct non decomposable lagrangian \ufb01lling strategy find legendrian such that the surgery on produces contact manifold that is strongly symplectically \ufb01llable but does not admit stein \ufb01lling an issue with this approach is lack of examples there are very few manifolds which carry strongly \ufb01llable but not stein \ufb01llable contact structures the main examples are the surgeries on the positive and negative trefoils see works by ghiggini ghi and tosun tos however it is not obvious whether any of these contact structures are contact surgery on legendrian knot in conclusion the desire to understand the \ufb02exibility and rigidity of lagrangian submanifolds has led to great deal of interesting research in symplectic topology similarly trying to understand constructions of and obstructions to lagrangian cobordisms has led to many interesting results at this point we have few concrete answers to the motivating questions stated in our introduction in particular regarding motivating question there are presently many candidates for legendrians that can be connected by lagrangian cobordism but not by decomposable lagrangian cobordism by understanding all the obstructions to lagrangian cobordisms can come up with some good candidates when trying and failing to construct lagrangian cobordism between given pair may gain intuition for additional obstructions to lagrangian cobordisms that are waiting to be discovered",
    "Abstract_Original": ". Lagrangian cobordisms between Legendrian knots arise in Sym-\nplectic Field Theory and impose an interesting and not well-understood\nrelation on Legendrian knots. There are some known \u201celementary\u201d build-\ning blocks for Lagrangian cobordisms that are smoothly the attachment\nof 0- and 1-handles. An important question is whether every pair of non-\nempty Legendrians that are related by a connected Lagrangian cobordism\ncan be related by a ribbon Lagrangian cobordism, in particular one that\nis \u201cdecomposable\u201d into a composition of these elementary building blocks.\nWe will describe these and other combinatorial building blocks as well as\nsome geometric methods, involving the theory of satellites, to construct\nLagrangian cobordisms. We will then survey some known results, derived\nthrough Heegaard Floer Homology and contact surgery, that may provide\na pathway to proving the existence of nondecomposable (nonribbon) La-\ngrangian cobordisms.\n1.
