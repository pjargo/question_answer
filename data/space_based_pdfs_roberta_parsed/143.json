atlas atlas v[a] is an expendable launch system and the fifth major version in the atlas launch vehicle family. it was originally designed by lockheed martin, now being operated by united launch alliance (ula), joint venture between lockheed martin and boeing. atlas is also major nasa launch vehicle. it is america's longest-serving active rocket. in august 2021, ula announced that atlas would be retired, and all 29 remaining launches had been sold.[10] as of 10 november 2022, 19 launches remain. each atlas launch vehicle consists of two main stages. the first stage is powered by russian rd-180 engine manufactured by energomash and burning kerosene and liquid the centaur upper stage is powered by one or two american engine(s) manufactured by aerojet rocketdyne and burns liquid hydrogen and liquid the star 48 upper stage was used on the new horizons mission as third stage. strap-on solid rocket boosters are used in most configurations. were used originally, but they were replaced in november 2020 by graphite-epoxy motor (gem 63) the standard payload fairings are 4.2 or 5.4 (14 or 18 ft) in diameter with various lengths.[11] the atlas was developed by lockheed martin commercial launch services as part of the u.s. air force evolved expendable launch vehicle (eelv) program and made its inaugural flight on 21 august 2002. the vehicle operates from at cape canaveral space force station and at vandenberg space force base. continued to market the atlas to commercial customers worldwide until january 2018, when united launch alliance (ula) assumed control of commercial marketing and sales.[12][13] the atlas first stage, the common core booster (not to be confused with the delta iv's common booster core), is 3.8 (12 ft) in diameter and 32.5 (107 ft) in length. it is powered by one npo energomash rd-180 main engine burning 284,450 (627,100 of liquid and the booster operates for about four minutes, providing about (900,000 of thrust.[14] thrust can be augmented with up to five aerojet or northrop grumman gem 63 strap-on solid rocket boosters, each providing an additional 1.27 (290,000 of thrust for 94 seconds. the main differences between the atlas and earlier atlas and family launch vehicles are: the \ufb01rst stage tanks no longer use stainless steel monocoque pressure stabilized \"balloon\" construction. the tanks are isogrid aluminum and are structurally stable when unpressurized.[14] accommodation points for parallel stages, both smaller solids and identical liquids, are built into \ufb01rst-stage structures.[14] the \"1.5 staging\" technique is no longer used, having been discontinued on the atlas with the introduction of the russian rd-180 engine.[14] the main-stage diameter increased from 3.0 to 3.7 (9.8 to 12.1 the centaur upper stage uses pressure-stabilized propellant-tank design and cryogenic propellants. the centaur stage for atlas is stretched 1.7 (5 ft in) relative to the atlas centaur and is powered by either one or two aerojet rocketdyne engines, each engine developing thrust of 99.2 kn (22,300 the inertial navigation unit (inu) located on the centaur provides guidance and navigation for both the atlas and centaur and controls both atlas and centaur tank pressures and propellant use. the centaur engines are capable of multiple inspace starts, making possible insertion into low earth parking orbit, followed by coast period and then insertion into gto.[16] subsequent third burn following multi-hour coast can permit direct injection of payloads into geostationary orbit. as of 2006, the centaur vehicle had the highest proportion of burnable propellant relative to total mass of any modern hydrogen upper stage and hence can deliver substantial payloads to high-energy state.[17] atlas payload fairings are available in two diameters, depending on satellite requirements. the 4.2 (14 ft) diameter fairing,[18] originally designed for the atlas booster, comes in three different lengths: the original (30 ft) version and extended 10 and 11 (33 and 36 ft) versions, first flown respectively on the av-008/astra and av-004/inmarsat-4 missions. fairings of up to 7.2 (24 ft) diameter and 32.3 (106 ft) length have been considered but were never implemented.[11] 5.4 (18 ft) diameter fairing, with an internally usable diameter of 4.57 (15.0 ft), was developed and built by ruag space[19] in switzerland. the ruag fairing uses carbon fiber composite construction and is based on similar flight-proven fairing for the ariane 5. three configurations are manufactured to support the atlas v:

fairing is much longer and fully encloses both the centaur upper stage and the payload.[20] many systems on the atlas have been the subject of upgrade and enhancement both prior to the first atlas flight and since that time. work on new fault tolerant inertial navigation unit (ftinu) started in 2001 to enhance mission reliability for atlas vehicles by replacing the existing non-redundant navigation and computing equipment with fault-tolerant unit.[21] the upgraded ftinu first flew in 2006,[22] and in 2010 follow-on order for more ftinu units was awarded.[23] in 2015, ula announced that the aerojet rocketdyne-produced solid rocket boosters then in use on atlas would be superseded by new gem 63 boosters produced by northrop grumman innovation systems. the extended gem boosters will also be used on the vulcan centaur launch vehicle that will replace the atlas the first atlas launch with gem 63 boosters happened on 13 november 2020.[25] proposals and design work to human-rate the atlas began as early as 2006, with ula's parent company lockheed martin reporting an agreement with bigelow aerospace that was intended to lead to commercial private trips to low earth orbit human-rating design and simulation work began in earnest in 2010, with the award of million in the first phase of the nasa commercial crew program to develop an emergency detection system (eds).[27] as of february 2011, ula had received an extension to april 2011 from nasa and was finishing up work on the eds.[28] nasa solicited proposals for phase in october 2010, and ula proposed to complete design work on the eds. at the time, nasa's goal was to get astronauts to orbit by 2015. then-ula president and ceo michael gass stated that schedule acceleration to 2014 was possible if funded.[29] other than the addition of the emergency detection system, no major changes were expected to the atlas rocket, but ground infrastructure modifications were planned. the most likely candidate for the human-rating was the configuration, with no fairing, no solid rocket boosters, and dual engines on the centaur upper stage.[29] on 18 july 2011, nasa and ula announced an agreement on the possibility of certifying the atlas to nasa's standards for human spaceflight.[30] ula agreed to provide nasa with data on the atlas v, while nasa would provide ula with draft human certification requirements.[30] in 2011, the human-rated atlas was also still under consideration to carry spaceflight participants to the proposed bigelow commercial space station.[31] in 2011, sierra nevada corporation (snc) picked the atlas to be the booster for its dream chaser crewed spaceplane.[32] the dream chaser was intended to launch on an atlas v, fly crew to the iss, and landing horizontally following lifting-body reentry.[32] however, in late 2014 nasa did not select the dream chaser to be one of the two vehicles selected under the commercial crew competition. on august 2011, boeing announced that it would use the atlas as the initial launch vehicle for its cst-100 crew capsule. cst-100 will take nasa astronauts to the international space station (iss) and was also intended to service the proposed bigelow commercial space station.[33][34] three-flight test program was projected to be completed by 2015, certifying the atlas combination for human spaceflight operations.[34] the first flight was expected to include an atlas rocket integrated with an uncrewed cst-100 capsule,[33] the second flight an in-flight launch abort system demonstration in the middle of that year,[34] and the third flight crewed mission carrying two boeing test-pilot astronauts into leo and returning them safely at the end of 2015.[34] these plans did not materialize. in 2014, nasa selected the boeing cst-100 space capsule as part of the program after extensive delays. atlas is the launch vehicle of the cst-100. the first launch of an uncrewed cst-100 capsule, boeing oft, occurred atop human-rated atlas on the morning of 20 december 2019; the mission failed to meet goals due to spacecraft failure, though the atlas launcher performed well.[35][36] in 2022, an atlas launched starliner capsule for the second time, ending with mission success.[37][38] amazon has selected the atlas to launch satellites for project kuiper. project kuiper will offer high-speed satellite internet constellation service. the contract signed with amazon is for nine launches. project kuiper aims to put thousands of satellites into orbit. ula is amazon's first launch provider.[39] each atlas booster configuration has three-digit designation. the first digit shows the diameter (in meters) of the payload fairing and has value of \"4\" or \"5\" for fairing launches and \"n\" for crew capsule launches (as no payload fairing is used when crew capsule is launched). the second digit indicates the number of solid rocket upgrades human-rating certification project

base price (for cst-100 starliner) [45] none dec ~13,000 [46] (to iss) before 2016, pricing information for atlas launches was limited. in 2010, nasa contracted with ula to launch the maven mission on an atlas 401 for approximately us$187 million.[47] the 2013 cost of this configuration for the u.s. air force under their block of 36 launch vehicles was us$164 million.[48] in 2015, the tdrs-m launch on an atlas 401 cost nasa us$132.4 million.[49] starting in 2016, ula provided pricing for the atlas through its rocketbuilder website, advertising base price for each launch vehicle configuration, which ranges from us$109 million for the 401 up to us$153 million for the 551.[1] each additional adds an average of million to the cost of the launch vehicle. customers can also choose to purchase larger payload fairings or additional launch service options. nasa and air force launch costs are often higher than equivalent commercial missions due to additional government accounting, analysis, processing, and mission assurance requirements, which can add us$30\u201380 million to the cost of launch.[50] in 2013, launch costs for commercial satellites to gto averaged about us$100 million, significantly lower than historic atlas pricing.[51] however, in recent years the price of an atlas [401] has dropped from approximately us$180 million to us$109 million, in large part due to competitive pressure that emerged in the launch services marketplace during the early 2010s. ula ceo tory bruno stated in 2016 that ula needs at least two commercial missions each year in order to stay profitable going forward.[52] ula is not attempting to win these missions on purely lowest purchase price, stating that it \"would rather be the best value provider\".[53] in 2016, ula suggested that customers would have much lower insurance and delay costs because of the high atlas reliability and schedule certainty, making overall customer costs close to that of using competitors like the spacex falcon 9.[54] in 2006, ula offered an atlas heavy option that would use three common core booster stages strapped together to lift 29,400 (64,800 payload to low earth ula stated at the time that 95% of the hardware required for the atlas heavy has already been flown on the atlas single-core vehicles.[11] the lifting capability of the proposed launch vehicle was to be roughly equivalent to the delta iv heavy,[11] which uses engines developed and produced domestically by aerojet rocketdyne. 2006 report, prepared by the rand corporation for the office of the secretary of defense, stated that lockheed martin had decided not to develop an atlas heavy-lift vehicle the report recommended for the u.s. air force and the national reconnaissance office (nro) to \"determine the necessity of an eelv heavy-lift variant, including development of an atlas heavy\", and to \"resolve the rd-180 issue, including coproduction, stockpile, or united states development of an rd-180 replacement\".[57] in 2010, ula stated that the atlas heavy variant could be available to customers 30 months from the date of order.[11] atlas in late 2006, the atlas program gained access to the tooling and processes for 5-meter-diameter stages used on delta iv when boeing and lockheed martin space operations were merged into the united launch alliance. this led to proposal to combine the 5-meter-diameter delta iv tankage production processes with dual rd-180 engines, resulting in the atlas phase 2. an atlas consisting of three 5-meter stages in parallel with rd-180s was considered in the augustine report as possible heavy lifter for use in future space missions, as well as the shuttle-derived ares and ares lite.[58] if built, the atlas was projected to be able to launch payload mass of approximately 70 (69 long tons; 77 short tons) into an orbit of 28.5\u00b0 inclination.[58] booster for rocket the atlas common core booster was to have been used as the first stage of the joint us-japanese rocket, which was scheduled to make its first flight in 2012.[59] launches would have been from the atlas launch complex at vandenberg air force base, however, the japanese government decided to cancel the project in december 2009.[60] out-licensing rejected by ula in may 2015, consortium of companies, including aerojet and dynetics, sought to license the production or manufacturing rights to the atlas using the engine in place of the rd-180. the proposal was rejected by launch cost historically proposed versions atlas launches 8/27/23, 9:36 atlas wikipedia 6/23

satellite, was launched to geostationary transfer orbit (gto) on 21 august 2002 by an atlas 401.[176] on 12 august 2005, the mars reconnaissance orbiter was launched aboard an atlas 401 launch vehicle from space launch complex 41 at cape canaveral air force station (ccafs). the centaur upper stage of the launch vehicle completed its burns over 56-minute period and placed into an interplanetary transfer orbit towards mars.[67] on 19 january 2006, new horizons was launched by lockheed martin atlas 551 rocket. third stage was added to increase the heliocentric (escape) speed. this was the first launch of the atlas 551 configuration with five solid rocket boosters, and the first atlas with third stage.[177] on december 2015, atlas lifted its heaviest payload to date into orbit 16,517 (7,492 cygnus resupply craft.[178] on september 2016, the osiris-rex asteroid sample return mission was launched on an atlas 411 launch vehicle. it arrived at the asteroid bennu in december 2018 and departed back to earth in may 2021 to arrive september 2022 at with sample ranging from 60 grams to kilograms in 2023.[179] the first four boeing spaceplane missions were successfully launched with the atlas v. the also known as the orbital test vehicle is reusable robotic spacecraft operated by usaf that can autonomously conduct landings from orbit to runway.[180] flights are launched on atlas from cape canaveral space force station in florida. the first vandenberg air force base landing at the space shuttle 15,000 ft (4,600 m) runway occurred in december 2010.[181] landings occur at both vandenberg and cape canaveral depending on mission requirements.[180] notable missions 8/27/23, 9:36 atlas wikipedia 14/23 on 20 december 2019, the first starliner crew capsule was launched in boe-oft un-crewed test flight. the atlas launch vehicle performed flawlessly but an anomaly with the spacecraft left it in wrong orbit. the orbit was too low to reach the flight's destination of iss, and the mission was subsequently cut short. in its 94 launches (as of july 2022), starting with its first launch in august 2002, atlas has achieved 100% mission success rate and 98.93% vehicle success rate.[182] this is in contrast to the industry success rate of 90%\u201395%.[183] the first anomalous event in the use of the atlas launch system occurred on 15 june 2007, when the engine in the centaur upper stage of an atlas shut down early, leaving its payload pair of ocean surveillance satellites in lower than intended orbit. the cause of the anomaly was traced to leaky valve, which allowed fuel to leak during the coast between the first and second burns. the resulting lack of fuel caused the second burn to terminate seconds early.[184] replacing the valve led to delay in the next atlas launch.[76] however, the customer (the national reconnaissance office) categorized the mission as success.[185][186] flight on 23 march 2016, suffered an underperformance anomaly on the first-stage burn and shut down seconds early. the centaur proceeded to boost the orbital cygnus payload, the heaviest on an atlas to date, into the intended orbit by using its fuel reserves to make up for the shortfall from the first stage. this longer burn cut short later centaur disposal burn.[187] an investigation of the incident revealed that this anomaly was due to fault in the main engine mixture-ratio supply valve, which restricted the flow of fuel to the engine. the investigation and subsequent examination of the valves on upcoming missions led to delay of the next several launches.[188] boeing starliner boeing elana geostationary operational environmental satellite inmarsat insight juno lucy lunar reconnaissance orbiter lunar crater observation and sensing satellite

program usa-212 in 2014, geopolitical and u.s. political considerations because of the russian war with crimea led to an effort to replace the russian-supplied rd-180 engine used on the first-stage booster of the atlas v. formal study contracts were issued in june 2014 to number of u.s. rocket-engine suppliers.[189] the results of those studies led to decision by ula to develop the new vulcan centaur launch vehicle to replace the existing atlas and delta in september 2014, ula announced partnership with blue origin to develop the lox/methane engine to replace the rd-180 on new first-stage

It was\noriginally designed by Lockheed Martin, now being operated by United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture\nbetween Lockheed Martin and Boeing. Atlas V is also a major NASA launch vehicle. It is America's longest-serving\nactive rocket. In August 2021, ULA announced that Atlas V would be retired, and all 29 remaining launches had\nbeen sold.[10] As of 10\u00a0November\u00a02022, 19 launches remain.\nEach Atlas V launch vehicle consists of two main stages. The first stage is powered by a Russian RD-180 engine\nmanufactured by Energomash and burning kerosene and liquid oxygen. The Centaur upper stage is powered by\none or two American RL10 engine(s) manufactured by Aerojet Rocketdyne and burns liquid hydrogen and liquid\noxygen. The Star 48 upper stage was used on the New Horizons mission as a third stage. Strap-on solid rocket\nboosters (SRBs) are used in most configurations. AJ-60A SRBs were used originally, but they were replaced in\nNovember 2020 by Graphite-Epoxy Motor (GEM 63) SRBs. The standard payload fairings are 4.2 or 5.4\u00a0m (14 or\n18\u00a0ft) in diameter with various lengths.[11]\nThe Atlas V was developed by Lockheed Martin Commercial Launch Services (LMCLS) as part of the U.S. Air Force\nEvolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program and made its inaugural flight on 21 August 2002. The vehicle\noperates from SLC-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (CCSFS) and SLC-3E at Vandenberg Space Force\nBase. LMCLS continued to market the Atlas V to commercial customers worldwide until January 2018, when\nUnited Launch Alliance (ULA) assumed control of commercial marketing and sales.[12][13]\nThe Atlas V first stage, the Common Core Booster (not to be confused with the Delta IV's Common Booster Core),\nis 3.8\u00a0m (12\u00a0ft) in diameter and 32.5\u00a0m (107\u00a0ft) in length. It is powered by one NPO Energomash RD-180 main\nengine burning 284,450\u00a0kg (627,100\u00a0lb) of liquid oxygen and RP-1. The booster operates for about four minutes,\nproviding about 4\u00a0MN (900,000\u00a0lbf) of thrust.[14] Thrust can be augmented with up to five Aerojet AJ-60A or\nNorthrop Grumman GEM 63 strap-on solid rocket boosters, each providing an additional 1.27\u00a0MN (290,000\u00a0lbf) of\nthrust for 94\u00a0seconds.\nThe main differences between the Atlas V and earlier Atlas I and II family launch vehicles are:\nThe \ufb01rst stage tanks no longer use stainless steel monocoque pressure stabilized \"balloon\" construction. The\ntanks are isogrid aluminum and are structurally stable when unpressurized.[14]\nAccommodation points for parallel stages, both smaller solids and identical liquids, are built into \ufb01rst-stage\nstructures.[14]\nThe \"1.5 staging\" technique is no longer used, having been discontinued on the Atlas III with the introduction of\nthe Russian RD-180 engine.[14]\nThe main-stage diameter increased from 3.0 to 3.7\u00a0m (9.8 to 12.1\u00a0ft).[15]\nThe Centaur upper stage uses a pressure-stabilized propellant-tank design and cryogenic propellants. The Centaur\nstage for Atlas V is stretched 1.7\u00a0m (5\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in) relative to the Atlas IIAS Centaur and is powered by either one or two\nAerojet Rocketdyne RL10A-4-2 engines, each engine developing a thrust of 99.2\u00a0 kN (22,300\u00a0 lbf). The inertial\nnavigation unit (INU) located on the Centaur provides guidance and navigation for both the Atlas and Centaur and\ncontrols both Atlas and Centaur tank pressures and propellant use. The Centaur engines are capable of multiple in-\nspace starts, making possible insertion into low Earth parking orbit, followed by a coast period and then insertion\ninto GTO.[16] A subsequent third burn following a multi-hour coast can permit direct injection of payloads into\ngeostationary orbit.\nAs of 2006, the Centaur vehicle had the highest proportion of burnable propellant relative to total mass of any\nmodern hydrogen upper stage and hence can deliver substantial payloads to a high-energy state.[17]\nAtlas V payload fairings are available in two diameters, depending on satellite requirements. The 4.2\u00a0m (14\u00a0ft)\ndiameter fairing,[18] originally designed for the Atlas II booster, comes in three different lengths: the original 9\u00a0m\n(30\u00a0ft) version and extended 10 and 11\u00a0m (33 and 36\u00a0ft) versions, first flown respectively on the AV-008/Astra 1KR\nand AV-004/Inmarsat-4 F1 missions. Fairings of up to 7.2\u00a0m (24\u00a0ft) diameter and 32.3\u00a0m (106\u00a0ft) length have been\nconsidered but were never implemented.[11]\nA 5.4\u00a0m (18\u00a0ft) diameter fairing, with an internally usable diameter of 4.57\u00a0m (15.0\u00a0ft), was developed and built by\nRUAG Space[19] in Switzerland. The RUAG fairing uses carbon fiber composite construction and is based on a\nsimilar flight-proven fairing for the Ariane 5. Three configurations are manufactured to support the Atlas V:\nVehicle description\nAtlas V \ufb01rst stage\nCentaur upper stage\nPayload fairing\n8/27/23, 9:36 PM\nAtlas V - Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V\n2/23\n[show]\n[show]\nStatus\nActive\nLaunch sites\nCape Canaveral,\nSLC-41\nVAFB,\nSLC-3E\nTotal launches\n97[3][4][5]\n401: 41\n411: 6\n421: 9\n431: 3\n501: 7\n511: 1\n521: 2\n531: 5\n541: 9\n551: 12\nN22: 2\nSuccess(es)\n97\n401: 41\n411: 6\n421: 9\n431: 3\n501: 7\n511: 1\n521: 2\n531: 5\n541: 9\n551: 12\nN22: 2\nFirst \ufb02ight\n21 August 2002\nHot Bird 6\nLast \ufb02ight\n10 November 2022\nJPSS-2\nType of\npassengers/cargo\nSpace probes\nPerseverance\nCuriosity\nInSight\nJuno\nLRO / LCROSS\nMMS\nMRO\nMAVEN\nNew Horizons\nOSIRIS-REx\nSolar Dynamics\nObservatory\nVan Allen Probes\nBoeing X-37B\nCygnus\nSolO\nStarliner\nGOES\nTDRS\nNRO classi\ufb01ed\npayloads\nIntruder\nQuasar\nSBIRS\n20.7\u00a0m (68\u00a0ft), 23.4\u00a0m (77\u00a0ft), and 26.5\u00a0m (87\u00a0ft) long.[19] While the classic 4.2\u00a0m (14\u00a0ft) fairing covers only the\npayload, the RUAG fairing is much longer and fully encloses both the Centaur upper stage and the payload.[20]\nMany systems on the Atlas V have been the subject of upgrade and enhancement both prior to the first Atlas V\nflight and since that time. Work on a new Fault Tolerant Inertial Navigation Unit (FTINU) started in 2001 to\nenhance mission reliability for Atlas vehicles by replacing the existing non-redundant navigation and computing\nequipment with a fault-tolerant unit.[21] The upgraded FTINU first flew in 2006,[22] and in 2010 a follow-on order\nfor more FTINU units was awarded.[23]\nIn 2015, ULA announced that the Aerojet Rocketdyne-produced AJ-60A solid rocket boosters (SRBs) then in use\non Atlas V would be superseded by new GEM 63 boosters produced by Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems.\nThe extended GEM 63XL boosters will also be used on the Vulcan Centaur launch vehicle that will replace the\nAtlas V.[24] The first Atlas V launch with GEM 63 boosters happened on 13 November 2020.[25]\nProposals and design work to human-rate the Atlas V began as early as 2006, with ULA's parent company\nLockheed Martin reporting an agreement with Bigelow Aerospace that was intended to lead to commercial private\ntrips to low Earth orbit (LEO).[26]\nHuman-rating design and simulation work began in earnest in 2010, with the award of US$6.7 million in the first\nphase of the NASA Commercial Crew Program (CCP) to develop an Emergency Detection System (EDS).[27]\nAs of February 2011, ULA had received an extension to April 2011 from NASA and was finishing up work on the\nEDS.[28]\nNASA solicited proposals for CCP phase 2 in October 2010, and ULA proposed to complete design work on the\nEDS. At the time, NASA's goal was to get astronauts to orbit by 2015. Then-ULA President and CEO Michael Gass\nstated that a schedule acceleration to 2014 was possible if funded.[29] Other than the addition of the Emergency\nDetection System, no major changes were expected to the Atlas V rocket, but ground infrastructure modifications\nwere planned. The most likely candidate for the human-rating was the N02 configuration, with no fairing, no solid\nrocket boosters, and dual RL10 engines on the Centaur upper stage.[29]\nOn 18 July 2011, NASA and ULA announced an agreement on the possibility of certifying the Atlas V to NASA's\nstandards for human spaceflight.[30] ULA agreed to provide NASA with data on the Atlas V, while NASA would\nprovide ULA with draft human certification requirements.[30] In 2011, the human-rated Atlas V was also still\nunder consideration to carry spaceflight participants to the proposed Bigelow Commercial Space Station.[31]\nIn 2011, Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) picked the Atlas V to be the booster for its still-under-development\nDream Chaser crewed spaceplane.[32] The Dream Chaser was intended to launch on an Atlas V, fly a crew to the\nISS, and landing horizontally following a lifting-body reentry.[32] However, in late 2014 NASA did not select the\nDream Chaser to be one of the two vehicles selected under the Commercial Crew competition.\nOn 4 August 2011, Boeing announced that it would use the Atlas V as the initial launch vehicle for its CST-100 crew\ncapsule. CST-100 will take NASA astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) and was also intended to\nservice the proposed Bigelow Commercial Space Station.[33][34] A three-flight test program was projected to be\ncompleted by 2015, certifying the Atlas V/CST-100 combination for human spaceflight operations.[34] The first\nflight was expected to include an Atlas V rocket integrated with an uncrewed CST-100 capsule,[33] the second flight\nan in-flight launch abort system demonstration in the middle of that year,[34] and the third flight a crewed mission\ncarrying two Boeing test-pilot astronauts into LEO and returning them safely at the end of 2015.[34] These plans\ndid not materialize.\nIn 2014, NASA selected the Boeing CST-100 space capsule as part of the CCD program after extensive delays. Atlas\nV is the launch vehicle of the CST-100. The first launch of an uncrewed CST-100 capsule, Boeing OFT, occurred\natop a human-rated Atlas V on the morning of 20 December 2019; the mission failed to meet goals due to a\nspacecraft failure, though the Atlas V launcher performed well.[35][36] In 2022, an Atlas V launched a Starliner\ncapsule for the second time, ending with mission success.[37][38]\nAmazon has selected the Atlas V to launch satellites for Project Kuiper. Project Kuiper will offer a high-speed\nsatellite internet constellation service. The contract signed with Amazon is for nine launches. Project Kuiper aims\nto put thousands of satellites into orbit.

In 2010, NASA contracted with ULA to launch the MAVEN mission on an Atlas V 401\nfor approximately US$187 million.[47] The 2013 cost of this configuration for the U.S. Air Force under their block buy of 36 launch vehicles was US$164\nmillion.[48] In 2015, the TDRS-M launch on an Atlas 401 cost NASA US$132.4 million.[49]\nStarting in 2016, ULA provided pricing for the Atlas V through its RocketBuilder website, advertising a base price for each launch vehicle configuration,\nwhich ranges from US$109 million for the 401 up to US$153 million for the 551.[1] Each additional SRB adds an average of US$6.8 million to the cost of\nthe launch vehicle. Customers can also choose to purchase larger payload fairings or additional launch service options. NASA and Air Force launch costs\nare often higher than equivalent commercial missions due to additional government accounting, analysis, processing, and mission assurance\nrequirements, which can add US$30\u201380 million to the cost of a launch.[50]\nIn 2013, launch costs for commercial satellites to GTO averaged about US$100 million, significantly lower than historic Atlas V pricing.[51] However, in\nrecent years the price of an Atlas V [401] has dropped from approximately US$180 million to US$109 million, in large part due to competitive pressure\nthat emerged in the launch services marketplace during the early 2010s. ULA CEO Tory Bruno stated in 2016 that ULA needs at least two commercial\nmissions each year in order to stay profitable going forward.[52] ULA is not attempting to win these missions on purely lowest purchase price, stating that it\n\"would rather be the best value provider\".[53] In 2016, ULA suggested that customers would have much lower insurance and delay costs because of the\nhigh Atlas V reliability and schedule certainty, making overall customer costs close to that of using competitors like the SpaceX Falcon 9.[54]\nIn 2006, ULA offered an Atlas V Heavy option that would use three Common Core Booster (CCB) stages strapped together to lift a 29,400\u00a0kg (64,800\u00a0lb)\npayload to low Earth orbit.[55] ULA stated at the time that 95% of the hardware required for the Atlas\u00a0V Heavy has already been flown on the Atlas\u00a0V\nsingle-core vehicles.[11] The lifting capability of the proposed launch vehicle was to be roughly equivalent to the Delta\u00a0IV Heavy,[11] which uses RS-68\nengines developed and produced domestically by Aerojet Rocketdyne.\nA 2006 report, prepared by the RAND Corporation for the Office of the Secretary of Defense, stated that Lockheed Martin had decided not to develop an\nAtlas\u00a0V heavy-lift vehicle (HLV).[56] The report recommended for the U.S. Air Force and the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) to \"determine the\nnecessity of an EELV heavy-lift variant, including development of an Atlas\u00a0V Heavy\", and to \"resolve the RD-180 issue, including coproduction, stockpile,\nor United States development of an RD-180 replacement\".[57]\nIn 2010, ULA stated that the Atlas V Heavy variant could be available to customers 30 months from the date of order.[11]\nAtlas V PH2\nIn late 2006, the Atlas V program gained access to the tooling and processes for 5-meter-diameter stages used on Delta\u00a0IV when Boeing and Lockheed\nMartin space operations were merged into the United Launch Alliance. This led to a proposal to combine the 5-meter-diameter Delta\u00a0 IV tankage\nproduction processes with dual RD-180 engines, resulting in the Atlas Phase 2.\nAn Atlas V PH2-Heavy consisting of three 5-meter stages in parallel with six RD-180s was considered in the Augustine Report as a possible heavy lifter\nfor use in future space missions, as well as the Shuttle-derived Ares\u00a0V and Ares\u00a0V Lite.[58] If built, the Atlas\u00a0PH2-Heavy was projected to be able to launch a\npayload mass of approximately 70\u00a0t (69 long tons; 77 short tons) into an orbit of 28.5\u00b0 inclination.[58]\nBooster for GX rocket\nThe Atlas V Common Core Booster was to have been used as the first stage of the joint US-Japanese GX rocket, which was scheduled to make its first\nflight in 2012.[59] GX launches would have been from the Atlas\u00a0 V launch complex at Vandenberg Air Force Base, SLC-3E. However, the Japanese\ngovernment decided to cancel the GX project in December 2009.[60]\nOut-licensing rejected by ULA\nIn May 2015, a consortium of companies, including Aerojet and Dynetics, sought to license the production or manufacturing rights to the Atlas\u00a0V using the\nAR1 engine in place of the RD-180. The proposal was rejected by ULA.[61]\nLaunch cost\nHistorically proposed versions\nAtlas V launches\n8/27/23, 9:36 PM\nAtlas V - Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V\n6/23\nFlight\nNo.\nDate\nand time\n(UTC)\nType\nSerial\nno.\nLaunch\nsite\nPayload\nType of\npayload\nOrbit\nOutcome\nRemarks\n1\n21 August\n2002\n22:05\n401\nAV-001\nCCAFS,\nSLC-41\nHot Bird 6\nCommercial\ncommunications\nsatellite\n(comsat)\nGTO\nSuccess [62]\nFirst Atlas V launch\n2\n13 May\n2003\n22:10\n401\nAV-002\nCCAFS,\nSLC-41\nHellas Sat 2\nCommercial\ncomsat\nGTO\nSuccess [63]\nFirst satellite for\nGreece and Cyprus\n3\n17 July\n2003\n23:45\n521\nAV-003\nCCAFS,\nSLC-41\nRainbow-1\nCommercial\ncomsat\nGTO\nSuccess [64]\nFirst Atlas V 500\nlaunch\nFirst Atlas V launch\nwith SRBs\n4\n17\nDecember\n2004\n12:07\n521\nAV-005\nCCAFS,\nSLC-41\nAMC-16\nCommercial\ncomsat\nGTO\nSuccess [65]\nLast \ufb02ight of the 521\ncon\ufb01guration\n5\n11 March\n2005\n21:42\n431\nAV-004\nCCAFS,\nSLC-41\nInmarsat-4 F1\nCommercial\ncomsat\nGTO\nSuccess [66]\nFirst Atlas V 400\nlaunch with SRBs\n6\n12 August\n2005\n11:43\n401\nAV-007\nCCAFS,\nSLC-41\nMars\nReconnaissance\nOrbiter (MRO)\nMars orbiter\nHeliocentric\nto\nAreocentric\nSuccess [67]\nFirst Atlas V launch\nfor NASA\n7\n19\nJanuary\n2006\n19:00\n551\nAV-010\nCCAFS,\nSLC-41\nNew Horizons\nPluto and Kuiper\nBelt probe\nHyperbolic\nSuccess [68]\nBoeing Star 48B thir\nstage used, \ufb01rst Atla\nV launch with a third\nstage.\n8\n20 April\n2006\n20:27\n411\nAV-008\nCCAFS,\nSLC-41\nAstra 1KR\nCommercial\ncomsat\nGTO\nSuccess [69]\n9\n9 March\n2007\n03:10\n401\nAV-013\nCCAFS,\nSLC-41\nSpace Test\nProgram-1\n6 military\nresearch\nsatellites\nLEO\nSuccess [70]\nFirst ULA Atlas\nlaunch\nFirst Atlas V nigh\nlaunch\nFirst three-burn\nAtlas V mission\nOrbital Express\nFalconSAT-3\n10\n15 June\n2007\n15:12\n401\nAV-009\nCCAFS,\nSLC-41\nUSA-194\n(NROL-\n30/NOSS-4-3A\nand -4-3B)\nTwo NRO\nReconnaissance\nsatellites\nLEO\nSuccess [71]\nFirst Atlas V \ufb02ight fo\nthe National\nReconnaissance\nOf\ufb01ce [72] Atlas did n\nachieve the intended\norbit, but payload\ncompensated for\nshortfall.

It will fly 19 more launches.[175]\nFor planned launches, see List of Atlas launches (2020\u20132029).\nThe first payload, the Hot Bird 6 communications satellite, was launched to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) on 21 August 2002 by an Atlas V 401.[176]\nOn 12 August 2005, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter was launched aboard an Atlas V 401 launch vehicle from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape\nCanaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS). The Centaur upper stage of the launch vehicle completed its burns over a 56-minute period and placed MRO into an\ninterplanetary transfer orbit towards Mars.[67]\nOn 19 January 2006, New Horizons was launched by a Lockheed Martin Atlas V 551 rocket. A third stage was added to increase the heliocentric (escape)\nspeed. This was the first launch of the Atlas V 551 configuration with five solid rocket boosters, and the first Atlas V with a third stage.[177]\nOn 6 December 2015, Atlas V lifted its heaviest payload to date into orbit \u2013 a 16,517\u00a0lb (7,492\u00a0kg) Cygnus resupply craft.[178]\nOn 8 September 2016, the OSIRIS-REx Asteroid Sample Return Mission was launched on an Atlas V 411 launch vehicle. It arrived at the asteroid Bennu in\nDecember 2018 and departed back to Earth in May 2021 to arrive September 2022 at with a sample ranging from 60 grams to 2 kilograms in 2023.[179]\nThe first four Boeing X-37B spaceplane missions were successfully launched with the Atlas V. The X-37B, also known as the Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV), is\na reusable robotic spacecraft operated by USAF that can autonomously conduct landings from orbit to a runway.[180] X-37B flights are launched on Atlas\nV's from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. The first Vandenberg Air Force Base landing at the Space Shuttle 15,000\u00a0ft (4,600\u00a0m) runway\noccurred in December 2010.[181] Landings occur at both Vandenberg and Cape Canaveral depending on mission requirements.[180]\nNotable missions\n8/27/23, 9:36 PM\nAtlas V - Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V\n14/23\nOn 20 December 2019, the first Starliner crew capsule was launched in Boe-OFT un-crewed test flight. The Atlas V launch vehicle performed flawlessly but\nan anomaly with the spacecraft left it in a wrong orbit. The orbit was too low to reach the flight's destination of ISS, and the mission was subsequently cut\nshort.\nIn its 94 launches (as of July 2022), starting with its first launch in August 2002, Atlas V has achieved a 100% mission success rate and a 98.93% vehicle\nsuccess rate.[182] This is in contrast to the industry success rate of 90%\u201395%.[183]\nThe first anomalous event in the use of the Atlas V launch system occurred on 15 June 2007, when the engine in the Centaur upper stage of an Atlas V shut\ndown early, leaving its payload \u2013 a pair of NROL-30 ocean surveillance satellites \u2013 in a lower than intended orbit. The cause of the anomaly was traced to a\nleaky valve, which allowed fuel to leak during the coast between the first and second burns. The resulting lack of fuel caused the second burn to terminate 4\nseconds early.[184] Replacing the valve led to a delay in the next Atlas V launch.[76] However, the customer (the National Reconnaissance Office)\ncategorized the mission as a success.[185][186]\nA flight on 23 March 2016, suffered an underperformance anomaly on the first-stage burn and shut down 5 seconds early. The Centaur proceeded to boost\nthe Orbital Cygnus payload, the heaviest on an Atlas to date, into the intended orbit by using its fuel reserves to make up for the shortfall from the first\nstage. This longer burn cut short a later Centaur disposal burn.[187] An investigation of the incident revealed that this anomaly was due to a fault in the\nmain engine mixture-ratio supply valve, which restricted the flow of fuel to the engine. The investigation and subsequent examination of the valves on\nupcoming missions led to a delay of the next several launches.[188]\nBoeing Starliner\nBoeing X-37\nELaNa\nGeostationary Operational Environmental Satellite\nGPS\nInmarsat\nInSight\nJuno\nLucy\nLunar Reconnaissance Orbiter\nLunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite\nMars Reconnaissance Orbiter\nCuriosity\nPerseverance and Ingenuity\nMAVEN\nMUOS-1 (200th Centaur upper stage launch)\nNew Horizons\nNROL launches\nOSIRIS-REx\nSolar Dynamics Observatory\nSolar Orbiter\nSpace Test Program\nUSA-212\nIn 2014, geopolitical and U.S. political considerations because of the Russian war with Crimea led to an effort to replace the Russian-supplied RD-180\nengine used on the first-stage booster of the Atlas V. Formal study contracts were issued in June 2014 to a number of U.S. rocket-engine suppliers.[189] The\nresults of those studies led to a decision by ULA to develop the new Vulcan Centaur launch vehicle to replace the existing Atlas V and Delta IV.[190]\nIn September 2014, ULA announced a partnership with Blue Origin to develop the BE-4 LOX/methane engine to replace the RD-180 on a new first-stage\nbooster. As the Atlas V core is designed around RP-1 fuel and cannot be retrofitted to use a methane-fueled engine, a new first stage is being developed.\nThis booster will have the same first-stage tankage diameter as the Delta IV and will be powered by two 2,400\u00a0 kN (540,000\u00a0 lbf) thrust BE-4\nengines.[189][191][192] The engine was already in its third year of development by Blue Origin, and ULA expected the new stage and engine to start flying no\nearlier than 2019.\nVulcan was initially planned to use the same Centaur upper stage as on Atlas V, and later to upgrade to ACES, however ACES is no longer being pursued,\nand Centaur V will be used instead.[193] It will also use a variable number of optional solid rocket boosters, called the GEM 63XL, derived from the new\nsolid boosters planned for Atlas V.[24]\nAs of 2017, the Aerojet AR1 rocket engine was under development as a backup plan for Vulcan.[194]\nAs of August\u00a02023, the first Vulcan flight is planned late 2023.[195]\nMission success record\nNotable payloads\nReplacement with Vulcan\nRetirement\n8/27/23, 9:36 PM\nAtlas V - Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V\n15/23\nIn August 2021, ULA announced that they are no longer selling launches on the Atlas V and they would fulfill their 29 existing launch contracts.[10] They\nmade a final purchase of the RD-180 motors they needed and the last of those motors were delivered in April 2021. The last launch will occur \"some time\nin the mid-2020s\".[10] As of October\u00a02022, 20 launches remain.\nCore stage of an Atlas V\nbeing raised to a vertical\nposition.\n \nX-37B OTV-1 (Orbital Test\nVehicle) being encased in\nits payload fairing for its 22\nApril 2010, launch.\n \nAn Atlas V 541 is moved to\nthe launch pad.\n \nAtlas V 401 on launch pad\n \nAtlas V ignition\nAn Atlas V 551 with the\nNew \nHorizons \nprobe\nlaunches from Launch Pad\n41 in Cape Canaveral.\nComparable rockets:\nAngara\nAriane 5\nDelta IV\nFalcon 9\nFalcon Heavy\nGSLV Mk III\nH-IIA\nH-IIB\nLong March 5\nProton\nVulcan Centaur\nZenit\nMedium-lift launch vehicle\nComparison of orbital launchers families\nComparison of orbital launch systems\na.
